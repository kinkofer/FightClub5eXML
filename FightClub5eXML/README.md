## About

Being a big fan of Lion Den’s Fight Club 5e and Game Master 5e apps for iOS and Android I was happy to see a kind soul (@fightclub5exml on twitter) had picked up the mantle of updating the compendium with content.

Unfortunately he seems to have deleted his twitter account so I am picking up where he left off by expanding on his work by adding Waterdeep Dragon Heist, Waterdeep Dungeon of the Mad Mage and Ghosts of Saltmarsh content to the XML.

Will take some time but will be making my way through each book and adding the items and monsters to bring it up to date.

Any questions hit me up on twitter [@dragonahcas](http://twitter.com/dragonahcas).
