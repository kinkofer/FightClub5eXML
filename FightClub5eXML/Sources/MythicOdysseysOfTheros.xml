    <text>Purphoros's hammer works wonders and disasters, the god of the forge using it to craft ground-breaking marvels and dangerous inventions in equal measure. Purphoros rarely bestows Akmon on mortals but occasionally leaves it unattended at his forge in Mount Velus. When Purphoros does permit a mortal to use the hammer, it's usually so they might bring an important work into being, wreck a force of destruction, or forge something remarkable somewhere the god isn't welcome.
Hammer of the Forge: This magic warhammer grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. When you hit with an attack using it, the target takes an extra 3d10 fire damage.
Blessing of the Forge: If you are a worshiper of Purphoros, you gain all the following benefits for which you have the required piety:
• Piety 10+.: The hammer has 1 randomly determined minor beneficial property.
• Piety 25+.: The hammer has 1 randomly determined major beneficial property.
• Piety 50+.: The hammer has 1 additional randomly determined major beneficial property.
If you aren't a worshiper of Purphoros, the hammer has 2 randomly determined minor detrimental properties.
See "Artifacts" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for details on randomly determined properties.
Reforged: While holding the hammer, you have resistance to fire damage and are immune to exhaustion. Additionally, you have proficiency with smith's tools and have advantage on all ability checks made using them.
Spells: While the hammer is on your person, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18): animate objects, heat metal, fabricate, magic weapon, mending, shatter. Once you use the hammer to cast a spell, the spell can't be cast again from it until the next dusk.
Destroying the Hammer: To destroy the hammer, it must be taken to the realm of Tizerus, in the Underworld. There it must be coated in clay from the Mire of Punishment. The heat of the hammer hardens the clay, which fuses to it after one month. Once fully hardened, the clay-covered hammer must be swallowed and digested by a kraken.

    <text>Thassa wields Dekella, a two-pronged weapon gifted to her by Purphoros. When the god of the sea bestows her weapon on a mortal, it's often so they might work her will far from the ocean, right some wrong affecting those she'd prefer not to harm, or give a mortal a glimpse of her terrible responsibilities.
Bident of the Deep: Thassa's signature weapon thrums with the icy currents of the deep ocean. This weapon functions as a trident that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. When you hit with an attack using the bident, the target takes an extra 2d10 cold damage.
Blessing of the Deep: If you are a worshiper of Thassa, you gain all the following benefits for which you have the required piety:
• Piety 10+.: You can breathe underwater, and you gain a swimming speed of 60 feet.
• Piety 25+.: The bident has 1 randomly determined minor beneficial property.
• Piety 50+.: The bident has 1 randomly determined major beneficial property.
If you aren't a worshiper of Thassa, the bident has 1 minor detrimental property and 1 major detrimental property, both randomly determined.
See "Artifacts" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for details on randomly determined properties.
Command the Deep: The bident holds the power to command the waves and its creatures. As an action, you can change the condition of the sea within 1 mile of you, creating strong winds and heavy rain that cause violent waves (see "Weather at Sea" in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide) or calming a storm. In either case, the unnatural weather lasts for 1 hour before returning to normal. Once used, this property of the bident can't be used again until the next dusk.
Additionally, you can cast the dominate monster spell (save DC 18) from the bident, but only on beasts and monstrosities that have an innate swimming speed. Once used, this property of the bident can't be used again until the next dusk.
Aquatic Metamorphosis: You can cast the true polymorph spell (save DC 18) from the bident, but you must cast it on a creature to turn it into a kind of creature that has an innate swimming speed. Once used, this property of the bident can't be used again until the next dusk.
Destroying the Bident: To destroy the bident, it must be heated by the breath of an ancient red dragon and then, while still hot, immersed in the Tartyx River.

    <text>Nylea wields the shortbow Ephixis, the bow whose arrows herald the turning of the seasons. Nylea is quick to let her favored followers borrow her bow, particularly when they intend to use it to perform great deeds, put an end to foul creatures, or cast down the arrogant.
Bow of the Wild: This divine weapon includes a shortbow and a quiver with four arrows, each tied to one of the four seasons. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this bow, and you suffer no disadvantage when attacking at the weapon's long range. Additionally, Ephixis scores a critical hit on a d20 roll of 19 or 20.
Blessing of the Wild: If you are a worshiper of Nylea, you gain all the following benefits for which you have the required piety:
• Piety 10+.: The bow has 1 randomly determined minor beneficial property.
• Piety 25+.: The bow has 1 randomly determined major beneficial property.
If you aren't a worshiper of Nylea, the bow has 1 randomly determined major detrimental property.
See "Artifacts" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for details on randomly determined properties.
Arrows of the Seasons: The four arrows—each associated with a season—that accompany this bow can be fired only from it. Each arrow disappears immediately after it's used, and it reappears in the quiver at the next dusk. The save DC against spells cast with the arrows is 18. Each arrow has a unique property:
Spring: As an action, you can fire this arrow, targeting a beast or a plant creature you can see within 320 feet of you. On a hit, the arrow deals no damage, and the target gains the benefits of the awaken spell for 8 hours.
Summer: As an action, you can fire this arrow at an unoccupied space on the ground that you can see within 320 feet of you, no attack roll required. A Nyxborn lynx is summoned in that space (use the stat block for a tiger with the Nyxborn traits from chapter 6). The lynx understands your verbal commands and obeys them as best it can, and it takes its turns immediately after yours. The emissary remains for 1 hour before fading away.
Autumn: As an action, you can fire this arrow at a space on the ground that you can see within 320 feet of you, no attack roll required, casting the wall of thorns spell there.
Winter: As an action, you can fire this arrow at a space that you can see within 320 feet of you, no attack roll required, casting the ice storm spell there.
Destroying the Bow: The bow can't be destroyed without first destroying all its arrows. The winter arrow must be fed to a cerberus on the winter solstice. The spring arrow must be planted at the base of a Black Oak of Asphodel on the spring equinox. The summer arrow must be broken by a sea giant on the summer solstice. Then the autumn arrow must be shot into the carcass of a hydra on the autumnal equinox. When all four arrows are destroyed, the bow and quiver dissolve into dust.

    <text>The chariot's riders and creatures pulling the chariot gain a +1 bonus to their AC.
If this magic chariot is pulled by one or more flying creatures, it too can fly.
Chariots: Chariots and the creatures pulling them work like controlled mounts, as described in the mounted combat rules in the Player's Handbook, but with the following differences:
• Mounting or dismounting a chariot costs you 5 feet of movement, rather than a number of feet equal to half your speed.
• Being mounted on a chariot grants you half cover.
• A chariot's speed is equal to the speed of the slowest creature pulling it.
• If multiple creatures are pulling the chariot, they all act on the same initiative, and they must take the same action on their turn.

    <text>While wearing this helm, you know whether there is a celestial or fiend within 30 feet of you, as well as where the creature is located, provided the creature isn't behind total cover.
Whenever you finish a long rest while wearing the helm, you can pray to one of the gods listed on the Helm of the Gods table and store the listed spell in the helm, replacing any spell that is already stored there. The save DC for the spell is 13.
The helm has 3 charges. To cast a spell from the helm, you must expend 1 charge, and the helm regains 1d3 charges daily at dawn.

    <text>Heliod wields Khrusor, a spear blessed with the power of the sun. In his hands, it can be pitched from Nyx to any point on Theros. When Heliod lends his weapon to a mortal, it's typically so they can perform some great work in his name or as a test of their worthiness.
Spear of the Sun: This spear grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. When you hit with an attack using this spear, the target takes an extra 2d8 radiant damage.
Blessing of the Sun: If you are a worshiper of Heliod, you gain all the following benefits for which you have the required piety:
• Piety 3+.: You gain 15 temporary hit points each dawn.
• Piety 10+.: The spear has 1 randomly determined minor beneficial property.
• Piety 25+.: The spear has 1 additional randomly determined minor beneficial property.
• Piety 50+.: The spear has 1 randomly determined major beneficial property.
If you aren't a worshiper of Heliod, the spear has 2 randomly determined major detrimental properties.
See "Artifacts" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for details on randomly determined properties.
Luminous: The spear sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The light is sunlight.
Sun's Retaliation: When you take damage from a creature within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee attack with the spear against that creature. On a hit, the spear deals damage as normal, and the creature is blinded until the start of its next turn. This property of the spear can't be used again until the next dawn.
Spells: The spear has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: guiding bolt (1 charge), daylight (3 charges, targeting the tip of the spear only), sunbeam (6 charges). The spear regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn.
Destroying the Spear: If taken to Erebos's palace in Tizerus, and used to sacrifice a champion of Heliod to Erebos, Khrusor is either destroyed or fundamentally twisted to Erebos's service.

    <text>Erebos wields Mastix, a whip capable of extending like an impossibly long shadow. In the hands of the god of the dead, the whip snares the reluctant dead and drags them into his realm. When Erebos grants his weapon to a mortal follower, it's typically to reclaim a powerful soul or to humiliate Heliod.
Whip of the Dead: Erebos's whip seethes with the enervating energy of the Underworld. This magic whip grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. When you hit with an attack using this whip, the target takes an extra 2d8 necrotic damage and you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt.
Additionally, when you make an attack with the whip on your turn, you can increase the range of the attack to 300 feet. This property of the weapon can't be used again until the next dusk.
Blessing of the Dead: If you are a worshiper of Erebos, you gain all the following benefits for which you have the required piety:
• Piety 1+.: The whip has 1 randomly determined minor detrimental property—a burden Erebos imposes to test his faithful.
• Piety 25+.: The whip has 1 randomly determined major beneficial property.
• Piety 50+.: The whip has 1 additional randomly determined major beneficial property.
If you aren't a worshiper of Erebos, the whip has 2 randomly determined major detrimental properties.
See "Artifacts" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for details on randomly determined properties.
Erebos's Claim: While carrying the whip, you can use an action to cast either circle of death or dominate monster (targeting only undead) from the whip. The save DC for these spells is 18. Once you use the whip to cast a spell, that spell can't be cast from it again until the next dusk.
Destroying the Whip: To destroy the whip, it must be taken to the heights of Mount Hiastos in Nyx, unraveled by a Returned, and left to bask in continual daylight for one month.

    <text>A creature that touches this ornate wooden vessel for 1 minute gains the benefits of a short rest. That creature also gains the effects of the bless spell until the creature finishes a short or long rest. The creature can't gain these benefits again until it finishes a long rest.
If the vessel is opened, roll on the Pyxis of Pandemonium table to determine what happens. Any spells cast by the vessel have a spell save DC of 17. One minute after the vessel is opened, it disappears. It reappears, sealed, in a random location on the same plane of existence 24 hours later.
Curse: Any creature that gains the benefit of a short rest from the vessel hears cloying telepathic whispers emanating from it. That creature must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is charmed by the vessel for 1 hour. The charmed creature does everything it can to open the vessel as soon as possible. On a successful save, the creature is immune to the vessel's whispers for 24 hours.

    <description>Akroan hoplites, also called stratians, number among the fiercest soldiers on Theros. They train relentlessly and possess unflinching resolve. In the annals of Akros, tales abound of squads of stratians that defended a key location against a much larger force or crept behind enemy lines and wreaked havoc in the opposing army.
Hoplites are highly trained warriors, versed not only in strategy and tactics but in the glorification of the warrior's spirit, the basis of an ethos that forges an unbreakable bond between members of a military unit. In combat, hoplites typically work in groups and use coordinated tactics to win victories.
The three Hoplite Unit Names tables present the sorts of titles used by hoplite contingents hailing from Theros's great poleis. Consider using these names for military forces characters encounter during their adventures or that they were once a part of.

    <description>Touched with the golden light of the sun, alseids inhabit meadows, plains, and lands of cultivated natural beauty. Many live in closer proximity to human civilization than other nymphs. Farmers are grateful for the presence of alseids on their lands and often leave them offerings of mead, honey, flowers, and dates in return for protecting their flocks and making their crops more abundant.
Nymphs:
Divine servants that inhabit unspoiled corners of the world, nymphs protect places of natural power and infuse their surroundings with the magic of Nyx. Some are benevolent and aid those who live off the land, while others embody violent aspects of nature. In either case, nymphs generally avoid other sapient creatures, preferring to mind the cycles of nature, the daily interplay of wild animals, or other cosmic forces. Occasionally, though, groups of the same kind of nymphs congregate in a place of natural power or beauty. In times of special need, deities tied to facets of nature might employ nymphs as messengers, guardians, or scouts.
A nymph doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>Prized among Meletis's thaumaturges, anvilwrought raptors are often crafted in the form of a hawk or an owl. Most serve as messengers and spies, flying over the busy streets or high over the land while carrying or seeking vital information for their masters.
The first anvilwroughts were created by the god of the forge, Purphoros. He gave the secret of breathing life into these metal creatures to his most devoted followers so they could mimic his works and invent new forms at their own forges.
Some anvilwroughts are vigilant guardians at holy shrines, others serve as familiars and messengers, and a few were created to emulate beauty found among the animals of the mortal world. Each exhibits abilities suited to its role, with some behaving like companionable creatures or stoic guardians.
A few extremely rare and valuable anvilwroughts were crafted by the hand of Purphoros himself. A number of these magnificent creations are now heirlooms of monarchs; others are lost to the sands of time or are guarded by ancient monsters.

    <description>The notorious Nyxborn harpy Aphemia prowls the marshy wastes around the necropolis of Asphodel. Her shrill songs enthrall the necropolis's undead inhabitants, which she leads on raids to waylay unsuspecting travelers and settlements.
Cruel, corpse-eating creatures, harpies endlessly seek their next meal, careless of whether it comes from the living or the dead. With equal zeal, these vicious scavengers set upon travelers or claw open fresh graves, stripping bodies of riches and flesh. Then they carry back any treasures or appealing bones they find to reeking nests situated in cramped caves or rotten trees.

    <description>A victim of the gods' petty rivalries, Arasta was once one of Nylea's most beloved dryad companions. Phenax's bitterness saw her transformed into an arachnid monstrosity and driven into the darkest depths of the Nessian Wood. Now she broods on her unjust fate and the fickleness of the gods who left her cursed with monstrous immortality.
Arasta appears as a gigantic spiderlike creature, her few humanoid features made monstrous by cruel magic and ages of hatred. Webs fill her lair deep in the Nessian Wood, sticky strands made not of silk but of her own endless hair. In her darkened realm, Arasta broods on her hatred of the gods and their servants. She doesn't do so alone, though, as innumerable arachnids fawn over her, serving as her eyes throughout the wilderness, disposing of victims trapped within her hair, and sacrificing themselves in her defense if they must.
See " Myths of Nylea" in chapter 2for more details on the tragedy of Arasta.

    <description>The epic accounting of the world's earliest histories calledThe Cosmogonyrecounts the battle between a group of the gods' champions and a mighty archon, which took place at the mysterious eastern edge of the world. Defeated, the falling archon is said to have met the rising sun. But Heliod showed mercy to the penitent archon, who swore to uphold justice and righteousness in the world's wildest places. As a sign of his mercy, Heliod gave the archon a spear that rivaled his own in its brilliance. This was the first archon of falling stars.
The mysterious conquerors known as archons once ruled vast empires. These armored warlords saw themselves as champions of merciless justice, and they ruled with iron fists. But their dominance ultimately came to an end. As the archon overlords toppled, they scattered to the fringes of the world, and their holdings developed into the poleis of today.
Even though the age of archons is long past, many wonder if the few surviving archons might someday attempt to reestablish their empire or if they are truly resigned to their lesser role in the world.

This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest.

    <description>The fall of the ancient archon empires left some archons bitter and resentful. Seeking to avoid the spread of human civilization, these archons made their way to the Underworld. The horrors of the place broke their minds, bodies, and spirits and twisted them into the terrifying archons known as ashen riders. When they ride forth upon the mortal world, terrified mortals make offerings in a desperate attempt to appease them, but the ashen riders aren't merciful, and they delight in reducing the paragons of the mortal world to ash.
The mysterious conquerors known as archons once ruled vast empires. These armored warlords saw themselves as champions of merciless justice, and they ruled with iron fists. But their dominance ultimately came to an end. As the archon overlords toppled, they scattered to the fringes of the world, and their holdings developed into the poleis of today.
Even though the age of archons is long past, many wonder if the few surviving archons might someday attempt to reestablish their empire or if they are truly resigned to their lesser role in the world.

    <description>Murderous gangs of harpies collect in grim places across Theros, preying on any who pass by. Many merchants face regular losses at the harpies' claws, common casualties often referred to as a "blood toll."
Cruel, corpse-eating creatures, harpies endlessly seek their next meal, careless of whether it comes from the living or the dead. With equal zeal, these vicious scavengers set upon travelers or claw open fresh graves, stripping bodies of riches and flesh. Then they carry back any treasures or appealing bones they find to reeking nests situated in cramped caves or rotten trees.

    <description>He is old and decrepit, garbed in ancient finery worn to tatters. A dented crown rests on his brow, and one of his horns ends in a jagged stump. He drags a rusty greataxe in the dirt, and tied to his back is a 30-pound, clay amphora painted with images of warring hoplites—all of whom have had horns crudely painted on them to make them look like minotaurs. The broad-mouthed amphora is large enough to hold roughly 55 gallons of wine.
He claims that he was a great king who was cursed by Mogis after he defied his war advisors by making his sickly but beloved child his heir. He was cast out and has since become tragically obsessed with finding a worthy heir.

    <description>The first bronze sables were presented to Karametra as a gift by Purphoros to serve primarily as guardians in Karametra's temples. But as others have been created, some have been used as nimble scouts, always on alert for danger.
The first anvilwroughts were created by the god of the forge, Purphoros. He gave the secret of breathing life into these metal creatures to his most devoted followers so they could mimic his works and invent new forms at their own forges.
Some anvilwroughts are vigilant guardians at holy shrines, others serve as familiars and messengers, and a few were created to emulate beauty found among the animals of the mortal world. Each exhibits abilities suited to its role, with some behaving like companionable creatures or stoic guardians.
A few extremely rare and valuable anvilwroughts were crafted by the hand of Purphoros himself. A number of these magnificent creations are now heirlooms of monarchs; others are lost to the sands of time or are guarded by ancient monsters.

    <description>Belief is a powerful force in Theros, capable of bringing about wonders and changing the world—but not always for the better. Doomwake giants arise from pernicious fears that infect a whole city or region. If enough mortals dread destruction for long enough, their terror can manifest as one of these massive Nyxborn beings. Once unleashed, a doomwake giant goes on a rampage, fulfilling the prophecy mortals believed into being. After doing so, these terrors typically roam to the edges of the world, where they either fade away over time or become legends that take on their own terrible life.
A spectrum of giants claims territory across Theros, drawing strength from aspects of the world itself—from ancient stone and roiling flames to the depths of the seas and skies. Unlike many creatures of legend, most giants owe their existence not to Nyx and the dreams of mortals, but to natural forces in the land. As a result, Theran giants are typically infused with the elements they embody, which might manifest as flaming beards, frozen skin, hair crackling with lightning, or other primal incarnations.
Beyond these primal giants, though, other giants fill the tales of Theros.

      <text>The eater of hope exhales a miasma of Underworld winds in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 26 (4d12) necrotic damage and is cursed for 1 minute. While cursed in this way, the target takes an extra 6 (1d12) necrotic damage whenever the eater of hope hits it with an attack. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and isn't cursed.</text>

    <description>An eater of hope is bitter to the core, resentful of all forms of life and joy. Although these demons can strike down most foes, they prefer to let terror and despair overtake their victims first, letting their victims marinate in fear before the fiend devours them.

    <description>Twice the size of normal lions and with resplendent manes of silvery or golden hair, fleecemane lions prowl and protect sites imbued with the power of Nyx. While the specifics of these massive lions' connection to Nyx is unclear, many myths tell of the deadly predators stalking mortals and spreading fear until they're ultimately defeated by a brave hunter. As a result, overcoming a fleecemane lion is widely considered an early step on the road to becoming a true hero.

    <description>When a mortal soul traumatically sacrifices its identity in order to escape the Underworld as a Returned, its identity manifests as a spirit-like eidolon.

They care nothing for morbid reunions with their lost bodies or Returned remnants.
Of the various types of eidolons, flitterstep eidolons are the most common and wander without purpose.

    <description>The original purpose of gold-forged sentinels is a mystery, and of all Purphoros's original anvilwroughts, this construct is the most difficult to control. A sentinel often operates without a master, stalking the high places of the mortal world or waiting, still as a statue, for what could be decades before reanimating to carry out their mysterious purpose.
The first anvilwroughts were created by the god of the forge, Purphoros. He gave the secret of breathing life into these metal creatures to his most devoted followers so they could mimic his works and invent new forms at their own forges.
Some anvilwroughts are vigilant guardians at holy shrines, others serve as familiars and messengers, and a few were created to emulate beauty found among the animals of the mortal world. Each exhibits abilities suited to its role, with some behaving like companionable creatures or stoic guardians.
A few extremely rare and valuable anvilwroughts were crafted by the hand of Purphoros himself. A number of these magnificent creations are now heirlooms of monarchs; others are lost to the sands of time or are guarded by ancient monsters.

    <description>Noble steeds of the sea, hippocamps feature in countless tales as guides and mounts to tritons and other ocean-faring heroes. While these curious but cautious aquatic equines naturally travel in herds, many hold valued places in triton society. Considered to be servants of Thassa, hippocamps are often unpredictable, but their great speed and strength can prove awe-inspiring when harnessed by the god's will.

      <name>Petrifying Gaze</name>
      <text>When a creature that can see Hythonia's eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of her, Hythonia can force it to make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw if she isn't incapacitated and can see the creature. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly petrified. Otherwise, on a failed save the creature begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic. Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see Hythonia until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at Hythonia in the meantime, it must immediately make the save. If Hythonia sees herself reflected on a polished surface within 30 feet of her and in an area of bright light, she is affected by her own gaze.</text>

    <description>Theros's reclusive medusas often delight in collecting and expanding their galleries of petrified victims. Unlike other medusas, Hythonia isn't merely a collector; she's an artist.
When Hythonia came to the island of Skathos, the inhabitants worshiped her as an avatar of the god Pharika. The cultists eagerly offered themselves up to the medusa's petrifying gaze in hopes of gaining Pharika's favor. Seeing herself surrounded by willing devotees, Hythonia formulated a cruel plan. After encouraging them to engage in wild rituals, Hythonia began turning her followers to stone, weaving their forms to create a grisly throne made of their petrified bodies.
While the medusa's victims have dwindled, tales of the medusa queen and the divine secrets she hoards have not. Hythonia eagerly trades the mysteries she knows but demands a constant price: a beautiful individual to become part of her throne.

    <description>Five-headed ironscale hydras lurk in the wild places of the world, being common foes for heroes seeking to test their mettle against terrors worthy of the gods' notice. Most ironscale hydras inhabit lakes and boggy caverns, from which they hunt unwary creatures that come for a drink or swim.
What krakens are to the sea and dragons are to the sky, hydras are to the lands of Theros. Various hydras dwell at the fringes of civilization, from the bog-dwelling hydras known across the multiverse to massive ironscale hydras that lurk in deep wildernesses. Beyond even these exist serpentine horrors born of the whims of foul gods, like the legendary hydra Polukranos.

    <description>Lampads guard the shadowed paths of the world, depths typically trod by souls destined for the Underworld. These rarely seen nymphs assist Athreos in guiding the dead, moving among the spirits that collect along the Tartyx River and reclaiming wayward souls that try to slip back to the mortal world. This means lampads are most often spotted in graveyards, crumbling crypts, and tunnels that bore deep into the earth, and near portals to the Underworld.
Nymphs:
Divine servants that inhabit unspoiled corners of the world, nymphs protect places of natural power and infuse their surroundings with the magic of Nyx. Some are benevolent and aid those who live off the land, while others embody violent aspects of nature. In either case, nymphs generally avoid other sapient creatures, preferring to mind the cycles of nature, the daily interplay of wild animals, or other cosmic forces. Occasionally, though, groups of the same kind of nymphs congregate in a place of natural power or beauty. In times of special need, deities tied to facets of nature might employ nymphs as messengers, guardians, or scouts.
A nymph doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>While leonin don't deny the existence of the gods, most denounce them, believing the deities are more likely to spread doom than peace and bounty. Some leonin, known as iconoclasts, devote themselves to thwarting the gods by hunting down their followers and all things born of Nyx that impede on Oreskos and the safety of the leonin prides.
Prides of leonin roam the plains of Oreskos, protecting the land and its creatures from interlopers, both mortal and immortal. As many leonin suffered at the hands of archon tyrants in ages past, today their prides largely avoid contact with other peoples and spurn the gods that ignored their plight. Since then, the leonin have flourished, finding strength in their bonds with one another and the land. Only in recent times have some leonin started guardedly looking beyond their homeland and wondering what role they might take in the wider world.
Most leonin hunters are tribal warriors, but those who hunt the servants of the gods rather than game are known as leonin iconoclasts.

      <name>Petrifying Gaze</name>
      <text>When a creature that can see the medusa's eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of the medusa, the medusa can force it to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw if the medusa isn't incapacitated and can see the creature. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the  greater restoration spell or other magic.</text>
      <text>Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the medusa until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the medusa in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.</text>

    <description>Meletian hoplites use a combination of cunning, faith, and magic to defend their coastal home. Most of these skilled soldiers serve in the Reverent Army, the defenders of Meletis, which uses an array of proven strategies and flexible troop formations to gain the advantage over foes. Bolstered by trained griffon and pegasus steeds, they strike foes where they least expect.
Hoplites are highly trained warriors, versed not only in strategy and tactics but in the glorification of the warrior's spirit, the basis of an ethos that forges an unbreakable bond between members of a military unit. In combat, hoplites typically work in groups and use coordinated tactics to win victories.
The three Hoplite Unit Names tables present the sorts of titles used by hoplite contingents hailing from Theros's great poleis. Consider using these names for military forces characters encounter during their adventures or that they were once a part of.

    <description>Naiads live in and near water. They might be spotted among rivers and lakes, on isolated shores, or amid coral labyrinths and deep sea fumaroles. Wherever rivers and seas show their variety and force, naiads gather to revel in nature's might. Individual naiads often grow fixated with a single type or body of water, potentially preferring a deep sea trench, coastline, or river system above all others. Over time, such a resident nymph often becomes connected with their aquatic home through sightings and stories, becoming a guardian of the place and, in effect, a manifestation of its personality.
Curious by nature, naiads often seek out what the seas and rivers claim. As a result, they might be found among sunken ruins and shipwrecks, sifting through the remains for whatever catches their eye. Living creatures aren't exempt from this curiosity, either. Naiads are known to befriend aquatic creatures, or even to keep modest menageries. The occasional star-crossed castaway has even been known to become part of such collections.
Sailors across the world claim that naiads know all the secret aquatic routes of Theros. Using this hidden system of currents and arteries, a ship might reach any destination in record time, be it across the sea or along a river a hundred miles inland. Naiads do nothing to dissuade sailors from this belief, and certainly numerous reports tell of charmed nymphs leading lost seafarers home. Yet, if tales of naiad-led galleys appearing amid the headwaters of mountain rivers are true, only the nymphs know for sure.
Nymphs:
Divine servants that inhabit unspoiled corners of the world, nymphs protect places of natural power and infuse their surroundings with the magic of Nyx. Some are benevolent and aid those who live off the land, while others embody violent aspects of nature. In either case, nymphs generally avoid other sapient creatures, preferring to mind the cycles of nature, the daily interplay of wild animals, or other cosmic forces. Occasionally, though, groups of the same kind of nymphs congregate in a place of natural power or beauty. In times of special need, deities tied to facets of nature might employ nymphs as messengers, guardians, or scouts.
A nymph doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.

Most of these gifted—or cursed—mortals communicate with a single god, interpreting their intentions for the wider world. Others aren't aligned with a god and observe the night sky, reading Nyx like a vast, cryptic scroll for insights.

    <description>Aggressive oreads number among the most dangerous nymphs, as they embody the wild might of flames, volcanism, and the hidden forces of the earth. These creatures typically dwell in remote mountain crags and near volcanoes, where they caper among the forces of dissolution and rebirth. During avalanches and volcanic eruptions, groups of oreads might race ahead of the destruction, dancing, singing, and doing what they can to maximize the impending devastation.
Hearkening back to some ages-old conflict, oreads refuse to knowingly destroy any land inhabited by another nymph. While they won't work to alter the natural course of destruction, neither will they make another nymph's home part of any calamity they encourage. As a result, part of what makes an alseid's field or a dryad's grove seem so blessed is that oreads go out of their way to leave such sites alone.
The followers of Purphoros regard oreads with special reverence, as myths tell of cagey smiths befriending these nymphs and convincing them to aid in creating phenomenal works. In some tales, a smith finds an oread and allows it to relish in the destruction of a novel or remarkable item. In recompense, the oread provides the smith with materials drawn from the burning heart of the world, allowing the smith to create an even greater wonder. In more tales, though, a smith pursues an oread, then later the mortal's associates find familiar tools and a heap of ashes.

      <text>Polukranos moves up to 50 feet in a straight line and can move through the space of any creature Huge or smaller. The first time it enters each creature's space during this move, it can make a stomp attack against that creature.</text>
    </legendary>
    <description>Polukranos, called the World Eater, is the mortal manifestation of the eternal ideal of a hydra. In its first incarnation, it fell from Nyx to the mortal world, and so great were its size and strength that the gods Nylea and Heliod combined their power to bind the monster deep within the Nessian Wood. That incarnation was slain, but the eternal ideal remains. A new incarnation of the World Eater is a fearsome omen, as the monster only appears when the pillars of the world tremble and terrible things are afoot in the realm of the gods. Its rampages often presage an age of menace for all civilization.
What krakens are to the sea and dragons are to the sky, hydras are to the lands of Theros. Various hydras dwell at the fringes of civilization, from the bog-dwelling hydras known across the multiverse to massive ironscale hydras that lurk in deep wildernesses. Beyond even these exist serpentine horrors born of the whims of foul gods, like the legendary hydra Polukranos.

    <description>Many Returned are pitiable souls who managed to escape from the Underworld only to find themselves stripped of the passions that motivated their flight. Lacking purpose and shunned by the living, these Returned typically seek places where they'll be left in peace, such as lonely tombs or the necropoleis of Asphodel and Odunos. There they go through half-hearted parodies of life, impeded by distraction and ennui. Despite this, even the most languorous Returned defend themselves if threatened and might be pressed into the service of their more willful brethren.
Returned have escaped the Underworld and dwell among the living once more, but their second lives are rarely what they expected—not that they remember what it was they expected. As a result of having followed the Path of Phenax (see chapter 4), the Returned lose their identities, which manifest as separate beings known as eidolons. The experience of escaping the Underworld also causes them to lose their faces, which become expressionless surfaces with empty eye sockets and gaping mouths. These blank surfaces they cover with distinctive golden masks.
Returned reenter the world blank and undead. No longer possessing the ability to form long-term memories, they generally can't build meaningful relationships or establish new lives. Instead, most experience fleeting emotions and follow hollow routines, their existences reduced to shadow plays without weight or substance.

    <description>Although the dead typically recall little of their lives, some have an obsession with magic that survives both death and rebirth as a Returned. These Returned, called kakomanteis, use their magical prowess to control the energy that suffuses the Underworld.

    <description>Even death and the loss of their identities can't erase the rage that inspires Returned palamnites. These Returned led violent lives, existences filled with such pain and hatred that violence now suffuses their deathless bodies. Such makes them exceptionally dangerous to the living, as these aimless killers know only suffering and seek to spread it whenever the opportunity arises. While palamnites might wander the world as dangerous, lone murderers, many gravitate to Odunos, where they serve the vicious will of Tymaret the Murder King (see chapter 3).
Returned have escaped the Underworld and dwell among the living once more, but their second lives are rarely what they expected—not that they remember what it was they expected. As a result of having followed the Path of Phenax (see chapter 4), the Returned lose their identities, which manifest as separate beings known as eidolons.

    <description>Pursuing lives of endless reverie, satyr revelers eagerly participate in celebrations wherever they find them. Their boisterous natures go far toward tempting others to eat, drink, and carouse with them. Faced with stodgier individuals or outright rivals, satyr revelers don't balk at using the magic of their music, dance, or other performances to charm opponents into joining their festivities. In the aftermath, these satyrs' foes are more likely to suffer embarrassment and groggy mornings than any lasting harm.
While most satyrs are known for their high spirits, love of revels, and gregarious personalities, these outgoing people are neither naive nor defenseless. Some satyrs delightedly torment stuffy individuals or pull pranks on the unwary, pastimes that can predictably lead to scuffles. If a satyr can't talk their way out of a conflict—or diffuse it with a good-natured distraction—they readily defend themselves, their friends, and their homes in the Skola Vale. With diversions aside, satyrs bend their cleverness toward tactics and methods of ending conflicts as swiftly as possible. This often means turning the same skills that make them famed celebrants toward battle, be it captivating performances or the aim developed through endless games of skill. Once a threat is overcome, though, satyrs are quick to engage in their favorite part of battle: the victory celebration.

    <description>Not all satyrs live lives of pure whimsy. When forced to defend their friends and homes, satyr thornbearers are quick to take up their bows and strike against danger. Particularly amid the dense trees of the Skola Vale, these satyr skirmishers cooperate in loose teams, using guerrilla tactics to harass foes then melt back into the forest. The blessings of Nylea aid the satyrs in protecting their home, and a single arrow from a thornbearer's bow might rain down like a volley from a whole army.

    <description>Most Setessan hoplites begin their training as hunters, making them skilled in traversing the woods and adept at both guerrilla tactics and archery. Their strategies often emulate the favored servants of Nylea—especially wild beasts like wolves and lynxes. Typically a few soldiers harry an enemy while the rest capitalize on their foe's distraction.
Hoplites are highly trained warriors, versed not only in strategy and tactics but in the glorification of the warrior's spirit, the basis of an ethos that forges an unbreakable bond between members of a military unit. In combat, hoplites typically work in groups and use coordinated tactics to win victories.
The three Hoplite Unit Names tables present the sorts of titles used by hoplite contingents hailing from Theros's great poleis. Consider using these names for military forces characters encounter during their adventures or that they were once a part of.

    <description>The term chimera applies to a wide variety of disparate monsters that combine the features of multiple beasts. While many artistic depictions represent chimeras as an amalgam of lion, ram, and dragon, these beasts appear with nearly endless variations.
The Akroans tell a tale of the first chimera's origin, wherein the god Keranos sought to test Nylea's favorite champion, Renata of Setessa, by creating a beast so deadly that even she would balk at trying to hunt it. When Renata slayed this lion-ram-dragon creation effortlessly, Keranos created another combination of deadlier beasts to challenge her. She slayed that beast, too. Despite countless attempts, Keranos was unable to create a beast that Renata couldn't best.
Chimeras typically roam the deep wilds of the world, constantly seeking a lair that would perfectly suit one of its heads, but then finding it unsatisfying to two-thirds of its being. As a result, a hungry chimera might appear out of a clear sky to pick off prey nearly anywhere. This threat grows even more significant in regions where magic runs rampant or where portals to the realm of Nyx exist, as unrestrained magical energy often causes more chimeras to appear in a region. As such chaotic magic is inherent to a chimera's being, these monsters often manage to shrug off spells cast against them.
Customizing a Chimera
The Theran chimera stat block presents one possible chimera configuration. You may customize these statistics to design your own unique chimera. To do so, simply roll once on one or all of the following tables. Results from the Body Composition table adjust the Theran chimera as described, while results on the Breath Weapons, Head Attacks, and Tail Attacks tables replace those respective actions in the stat block. Theran chimeras always have the Claws action. If the results of multiple tables conflict, chose your preferred result.

    <description>Triton masters of waves sculpt storms and change the tides, bending the sea to their will. Drawing forth living currents and the icy cold of the deep, these mages make the ocean their ally, using it to defend their people or enact Thassa's wishes. While dire threats from the land might bring them to coastal shallows, most masters of waves keep to the ocean's depths.
Although many masters of waves resent land-dwellers and strike out at those who trespass upon their waters, most are devoted followers of the sea god. Those who share their faith or who bear earnest offerings to Thassa might defuse the tritons' ire—that is, if they survive the deadly winds and waves that typically herald these sea guardians' appearance.
Clever, far-ranging people of the sea, tritons live rich lives unknown to most land-dwelling individuals. While the waves separate most tritons from land-dwellers, occasionally the inhabitants of the surface and the deep come into conflict. In such cases, tritons prove skilled at sabotaging ocean-going vessels, employing water-based magic, and otherwise whipping up the fury of the sea. Few dare insult tritons in their home environment, but those who do and survive often learn that the tritons' wrath doesn't end at the shore.

    <description>Some insults don't wash away with the tides. When surface dwellers threaten the safety of triton communities, impede upon Thassa's holiest depths, or steal the treasures of the deep, triton shorestalkers seek vengeance. Using speed and poison harvested from deadly sea beasts, these triton assassins slip into shallow waters and strike when least expected. Often, surface dwellers don't even realize they've been attacked by shorestalkers, chalking disappearances and deaths up to the innumerable dangers of the sea.

    <description>Most krakens roam the seas, shattering hulls and scattering fleets, but the kraken Tromokratis notoriously vents its wrath on coastal settlements. Whether it acts at the command of the god Thassa or to sate its own hunger, Tromokratis numbers among the most feared threats in the sea, having no fixed lair and wandering where it will. In recent memory, the massive menace rose from the waves to topple the Pyrgnos, Meletis's great repository of scholarly knowledge. Since that day, the polis keeps a watch specifically for Tromokratis.

    <description>Thought to be a lesser breed of cerberi that have interbred with mortal wolves, two-headed cerberi typically roam the mortal side of the Tartyx River. There they generally ignore—or only modestly menace—the souls of the dead. Such isn't the case for mortals, though, and they eagerly set upon those who tread too close to the Underworld's borders.
Feared by the living and the dead, cerberi patrol both banks of the Tartyx River. These multiheaded hounds of the Underworld breathe gouts of molten rock that sear and imprison those who trespass upon the borders of life and death. Most cerberi have a boundless hunger for fresh meat, especially the flesh of humanoids. Villains have been known to exploit that hunger by luring cerberi away from the river and setting them loose on mortal settlements.

    <description>Titanic horrors of writhing flesh and gnashing maws, typhons slither through the Underworld seeking only to consume. Once the souls of mortal warlords and cruel tyrants, typhons come into being over ages of festering bitterness and rage. Over time, these souls twist into eternally ravenous monstrosities, which rampage through the realm of the dead, consuming souls by the thousands. The Underworld remains their prison, though, and most would relish nothing more than to escape and slaughter the living once more.

      <text>The cerberus exhales a 30-foot cone of molten rock. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, a creature is also restrained by the hardening rock. A creature can make a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check as an action, freeing itself or a creature within reach from the rock on a success. The rock has AC 17 and 20 hit points, and it is immune to fire, poison, and psychic damage.</text>

    <description>Three-headed cerberi dwell deep in the Underworld. Terrifying and cunning, they guard portals between the wards of the Underworld, Erebos's greatest treasures, and noteworthy souls who might attempt to escape the realm of the dead. Three-headed cerberi commonly serve demons, but if left to their own devices, they often herd wily souls into labyrinthine Underworld wildernesses, then hunt them for sport.
Feared by the living and the dead, cerberi patrol both banks of the Tartyx River. These multiheaded hounds of the Underworld breathe gouts of molten rock that sear and imprison those who trespass upon the borders of life and death. Most cerberi have a boundless hunger for fresh meat, especially the flesh of humanoids. Villains have been known to exploit that hunger by luring cerberi away from the river and setting them loose on mortal settlements.

    <description>Archons always ride into battle on fearsome winged mounts. Some legends suggest that the mount is actually a physical manifestation of the archon's will, allowing the pair to act with a single mind. The two most common archon mounts are winged bulls and winged lions.

    <description>Woe striders form from the souls of those who've broken the bonds of destiny. Over centuries, these cosmic blasphemers transform into hunched, long-limbed horrors. Sadistic things, woe striders seek ways to reweave themselves into the tapestry of destiny. This leads them to search for answers within the bowels of other beings, performing murderous haruspicy in pursuit of their discarded cosmic purpose. When they fail to find answers, their unnatural cries cause reality to shudder, undermining magic and sane minds alike.
