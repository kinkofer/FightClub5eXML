        <name>Description</name>
      <text>You have spent your life in the service of a temple to a specific god or pantheon of gods. You act as an intermediary between the realm of the holy and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine. You are not necessarily a cleric—performing sacred rites is not the same thing as channeling divine power.
Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi-divine being, and work with your DM to detail the nature of your religious service. The Gods of the Multiverse section contains a sample pantheon, from the Forgotten Realms setting. Were you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or were you a high priest who suddenly experienced a call to serve your god in a different way? Perhaps you were the leader of a small cult outside of any established temple structure, or even an occult group that served a fiendish master that you now deny.

      <text>As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.
You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your temple.

      <text>Acolytes are shaped by their experience in temples or other religious communities. Their study of the history and tenets of their faith and their relationships to temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme.

      <text>As a member of the Azorius Senate, you are probably engaged in the work of law enforcement (even if your background involved the legislative or judicial aspects of the senate's activities). Legislative aides and judges' clerks find little reason to venture beyond the Azorius guildhalls, but soldiers and lawmages patrol the streets daily.
An Azorius soldier or lawmage is a force for order, charged with fighting crime on the streets—and in the halls of power. You might spend your time foiling thefts, putting a stop to Orzhov extortion, rooting out Dimir spies, or hunting down Golgari assassins. Perhaps you take your orders from a precognitive mage (or you are one yourself) who receives unpredictable and cryptic visions of future crimes that you and your allies must try to prevent.

While this isn't remarkable for most of the city's larger faiths, keeping track of the hundreds of religions newcomers bring with them is no mean feat.

You're well-versed in the mannerisms and idiosyncrasies of Baldurian patriars and other nobles, imitating them smoothly enough to convince even the snootiest family heads of your authenticity. You're skilled at posing as the long-lost heir to some imaginary or extinguished patriar lineage.
Because of your skill in passing yourself off as a patriar, you have a Watch token that allows you alone into the Upper City of Baldur's Gate. You might be able to bluff others through with you, or even convince members of the Watch that you're a patriar. However, any true test of your authenticity is likely to reveal your deception.

In Baldur's Gate, crime is just another business. As a result, you can arrange a meeting with a low-ranking operative of nearly any business, patriar family, crew, government institution, or—certainly—the Guild. This operative will hear you out and, at their discretion, take your information or request up their chain of command. These meetings almost always occur in shady venues.

      <text>Criminals are pervasive in Baldur's Gate. If you wish, you may roll on the Criminal Origins table for an event that began your life of crime.
Criminal Origins
d8 | Origin
1 | You crippled a Guild kingpin's cousin without realizing the connection. You got the Guild to back off demands for your death by offering to make amends by working for the criminals, but even so the kingpin still plots a personal revenge.
2 | The Guild took over your family business, ran it into the ground, and burned the building for insurance money. You were driven into crime yourself, but you'll never work for the Guild. You take special joy in hitting its targets first, tipping off its con victims and otherwise frustrating its schemes.
3 | It's always been about money. You're not paid what you're worth, working for someone who has more than they deserve. But the Guild offered you a way to fix that. You keep doing what you've always done—guard work, dock labor, business accounting—but what you learn you pass on to the Guild.
4 | The inequality of Baldur's Gate has driven you to take matters into your own hands. You steal from patriars and rich Lower City residents, funneling the money through charitable fronts to help the needy.
5 | You got into crime as a bored patriar looking for excitement. Your family has no idea of your activities, and neither does the Guild. If either of them ever finds out, your life as you know it will be over.
6 | A close friend or relative joined the Guild and vanished mysteriously. You've worked your way into the lower ranks hoping to find out what happened to them.
7 | You've always wanted to be a member of the Guild. As a child, you looked up to the Guild members' swagger, their flashy dress, and their competence, which all marked them as different from the other adults you knew. As soon as you could, you joined the organization.
8 | To you, this is just a way to earn a living. You go to work, do what needs to be done, and get paid. Anyone who pursues crime for thrill-seeking, to strike back at unjust authorities, or anything else are amateurs, and they're liable to get you arrested or killed with their idiocy.

5 | I am incredibly slow to trust. Those who seem the fairest often have the most to hide.
6 | I don't pay attention to the risks in a situation. Never tell me the odds.
7 | The best way to get me to do something is to tell me I can't do it.
8 | I blow up at the slightest insult.

d6 | Ideal
1 | Honor. I don't steal from others in the trade. (Lawful)

5 | I'm guilty of a terrible crime. I hope I can redeem myself for it.
6 | Someone I loved died because of a mistake I made. That will never happen again.

d6 | Flaw
1 | When I see something valuable, I can't think about anything but how to steal it.
2 | When faced with a choice between money and my friends, I usually choose the money.
3 | If there's a plan, I'll forget it. If I don't forget it, I'll ignore it.
4 | I have a 'tell' that reveals when I'm lying.
5 | I turn tail and run when things look bad.
6 | An innocent person is in prison for a crime that I committed. I'm okay with that.

      <text>The effects of a Baldur's Gate feature can be used only while the character is in Baldur's Gate—though, at the DM's discretion, they might have applicable effects in situations similar to those in Baldur's Gate.
You're familiar with the city's crews, their territories, and inter-crew politics. Choose one of the three districts of Baldur's Gate: the Upper City, the Lower City, or the Outer City. This is the district where you conduct most of your business. Whenever you need information about something in one of that district's neighborhoods, you can seek out crew members in that area and learn the local gossip. You can also gain unimpeded entry to nearly any bank, guild hall, place of business, workhouse, or crew meeting place in your district.

      <text>Guilds are generally found in cities large enough to support several artisans practicing the same trade. However, your guild might instead be a loose network of artisans who each work in a different village within a larger realm. Work with your DM to determine the nature of your guild. You can select your guild business from the Guild Business table or roll randomly.

      <text>Guild artisans are among the most ordinary people in the world—until they set down their tools and take up an adventuring career. They understand the value of hard work and the importance of community, but they're vulnerable to sins of greed and covetousness.

        <name>Feature: Discovery</name>
      <text>The quiet seclusion of your extended hermitage gave you access to a unique and powerful discovery. The exact nature of this revelation depends on the nature of your seclusion. It might be a great truth about the cosmos, the deities, the powerful beings of the outer planes, or the forces of nature. It could be a site that no one else has ever seen. You might have uncovered a fact that has long been forgotten, or unearthed some relic of the past that could rewrite history. It might be information that would be damaging to the people who or consigned you to exile, and hence the reason for your return to society.
Work with your DM to determine the details of your discovery and its impact on the campaign.

You know the Baldur's Gate most Baldurians ignore, the dog-eat-dog world of the homeless and unfortunate. You know where to go in the Lower City and Outer City for anonymity. In these slums and alley camps, you can get a damp bed and a bad meal, but also a degree of privacy and no questions asked. Living here isn't comfortable, but it's unlikely anyone will find you—and you can stay as long as you want.

Hermit Origins
d6 | Origin
1 | You led an ill-fated expedition into the Riverveins. Your friends were swept away by flooding, and you've never been able to shake the guilt of causing their deaths over a frivolous lark. You've maintained a solitary vigil outside the cavern entrance ever since.
2 | You crossed the Guild in a bad way. Fortunately, its members think you're dead. Less fortunately, maintaining that deception might require you to stay in hiding until you actually are.
3 | You study the puzzles of mortal natures. You've seen followers of evil deities perform miracles for the helpless at Twin Songs, and you've seen patriars who worship good deities turn their backs on the poor daily. Bearing witness to such things, and meditating on their contradictions, fills your hours.
4 | You tend to some part of the city's forgotten history: the unmarked graves in Cliffside Cemetery, the crumbling remains of dead patriar families' manors, or a collection of religious texts stuffed into an attic and forgotten when a believer's patron deity died. In this solitary work, you've learned secrets no one else knows.
5 | You killed a patriar's scion in an illegal duel. The family swore revenge, and you fled to the slums rather than risk bringing their wrath down on your kin.
6 | You aren't originally from Baldur's Gate. You came here seeking something else, only to learn that the quest that drove you had become impossible to fulfill—its object was destroyed or its purpose was negated by some superseding event. Suddenly directionless and unable to return to your homeland, you have lingered, adrift, in this wretched city.

4 | I retreated from society after a life-altering event.
5 | I needed a quiet place to work on my art, literature, music, or manifesto.

      <text>Some hermits are well suited to a life of seclusion, whereas others chafe against it and long for company. Whether they embrace solitude or long to escape it, the solitary life shapes their attitudes and ideals. A few are driven slightly mad by their years apart from society.
d8 | Personality Trait
1 | I've been isolated for so long that I rarely speak, preferring gestures and the occasional grunt.
2 | I am utterly serene, even in the face of disaster.
3 | The leader of my community had something wise to say on every topic, and I am eager to share that wisdom.
4 | I feel tremendous empathy for all who suffer.
5 | I'm oblivious to etiquette and social expectations.
6 | I connect everything that happens to me to a grand, cosmic plan.
7 | I often get lost in my own thoughts and contemplation, becoming oblivious to my surroundings.
8 | I am working on a grand philosophical theory and love sharing my ideas.

d6 | Ideal
1 | Greater Good. My gifts are meant to be shared with all, not used for my own benefit. (Good)
2 | Logic. Emotions must not cloud our sense of what is right and true, or our logical thinking. (Lawful)
3 | Free Thinking. Inquiry and curiosity are the pillars of progress. (Chaotic)
4 | Power. Solitude and contemplation are paths toward mystical or magical power. (Evil)
5 | Live and Let Live. Meddling in the affairs of others only causes trouble. (Neutral)
6 | Self-Knowledge. If you know yourself, there's nothing left to know. (Any)

d6 | Bond
1 | Nothing is more important than the other members of my hermitage, order, or association.
2 | I entered seclusion to hide from the ones who might still be hunting me. I must someday confront them.
3 | I'm still seeking the enlightenment I pursued in my seclusion, and it still eludes me.
4 | I entered seclusion because I loved someone I could not have.
5 | Should my discovery come to light, it could bring ruin to the world.
6 | My isolation gave me great insight into a great evil that only I can destroy.

d6 | Flaw
1 | Now that I've returned to the world, I enjoy its delights a little too much.
2 | I harbor dark, bloodthirsty thoughts that my isolation and meditation failed to quell.
3 | I am dogmatic in my thoughts and philosophy.
4 | I let my need to win arguments overshadow friendships and harmony.
5 | I'd risk too much to uncover a lost bit of knowledge.
6 | I like keeping secrets and won't share them with anyone.

As a member of one of the elite families of Baldur's Gate, you may pass through city gates without paying tolls, mingle among the Gate's nobility unquestioned, and impress those on the lookout for wealthy patrons. You are welcome in the Upper City and may stay there after dark without being harassed or evicted. Your word is accepted over others' without question, and any corruption among guards or government officials tends to work in your favor, not against you—at least until you make some effort to expose it.

    <trait>
        <name>Suggested Characteristics</name>
      <text>Nobles are born and raised to a very different lifestyle than most people ever experience, and their personalities reflect that upbringing. A noble title comes with a plethora of bonds—responsibilities to family, to other nobles (including the sovereign), to the people entrusted to the family's care, or even to the title itself. But this responsibility is often a good way to undermine a noble.
d8 | Personality Trait
1 | My eloquent flattery makes everyone I talk to feel like the most wonderful and important person in the world.
2 | The common folk love me for my kindness and generosity.
3 | No one could doubt by looking at my regal bearing that I am a cut above the unwashed masses.
4 | I take great pains to always look my best and follow the latest fashions.
5 | I don't like to get my hands dirty, and I won't be caught dead in unsuitable accommodations.
6 | Despite my noble birth, I do not place myself above other folk. We all have the same blood.
7 | My favor, once lost, is lost forever.
8 | If you do me an injury, I will crush you, ruin your name, and salt your fields.

d6 | Ideal

2 | Responsibility. It is my duty to respect the authority of those above me, just as those below me must respect mine. (Lawful)
3 | Independence. I must prove that I can handle myself without coddling from my family. (Chaotic)
4 | Power. If I can attain more power, no one will tell me what to do. (Evil)

5 | My loyalty to my sovereign is unwavering.
6 | The common folk must see me as a hero of the people.

d6 | Flaw
1 | I secretly believe that everyone is beneath me.
2 | I hide a truly scandalous secret that could ruin my family forever.
3 | I too often hear veiled insults and threats in every word addressed to me, and I'm quick to anger.
4 | I have an insatiable desire for carnal pleasures.
5 | In fact, the world does revolve around me.
6 | By my words and actions, I often bring shame to my family.

Outlander Origins
d6 | Origin
1 | Someone stole something precious from your people. You tracked the thief to the city gates, but finding clues in an urban environment is very different from tracking someone across the wilderness. You don't know where to go from here, but your people need you to succeed.
2 | You've always been fascinated by the glitter and glamor of city life, so different from the slow pace of life in your homeland. Now you're here, ready to make your mark in the world, but unsure how to begin.
3 | War, plague, famine, or a marauding monster ravaged your home, forcing you to flee for your life. You don't even know how many of your people survived or where to find them. Alone or accompanied by a handful of equally bereft survivors, you must navigate a new life that you never asked for.
4 | You were captured by kidnappers and taken far from your home. The Knights of the Unicorn freed you and brought you here, but now you're on your own.
5 | You were exiled for breaking a trivial-seeming taboo. For this seemingly minor transgression, you lost your friends, family, and homeland in one fell swoop, and were given little choice but to strike out on your own.
6 | A peddler once brought something astonishing to your homeland—a Gondan clockwork, shimmering cloth of gold, a trained speaking bird, or some other small wonder—and told you that it came from Baldur's Gate. You've come to see the source of such wonders, and perhaps learn to create them.

      <text>Often considered rude and uncouth among civilized folk, outlanders have little respect for the niceties of life in the cities. The ties of tribe, clan, family, and the natural world of which they are a part are the most important bonds to most outlanders.
d8 | Personality Trait
1 |  I'm driven by a wanderlust that led me away from home.
2 | I watch over my friends as if they were a litter of newborn pups.
3 | I once ran twenty-five miles without stopping to warn to my clan of an approaching orc horde. I'd do it again if I had to.
4 | I have a lesson for every situation, drawn from observing nature.
5 | I place no stock in wealthy or well-mannered folk. Money and manners won't save you from a hungry owlbear.

1 | My family, clan, or tribe is the most important thing in my life, even when they are far from me.

4 | I am the last of my tribe, and it is up to me to ensure their names enter legend.
5 | I suffer awful visions of a coming disaster and will do anything to prevent it.
6 | It is my duty to provide children to sustain my tribe.

d6 | Flaw
1 | I am too enamored of ale, wine, and other intoxicants.
2 | There's no room for caution in a life lived to the fullest.
3 | I remember every insult I've received and nurse a silent resentment toward anyone who's ever wronged me.
4 | I am slow to trust members of other races, tribes, and societies.
5 |  Violence is my answer to almost any challenge.
6 |  Don't expect me to save those who can't save themselves. It is nature's way that the strong thrive and the weak perish.

Because you're calling in a favor, you can't be certain of a schedule or route that will meet your every need. Your Dungeon Master will determine how long it takes to get where you need to go. In return for your free passage, you and your companions are expected to assist the crew during the voyage.

      <text>The effects of a Baldur's Gate feature can be used only while the character is in Baldur's Gate—though, at the DM's discretion, they might have applicable effects in situations similar to those in Baldur's Gate.
You're familiar with the docks of Baldur's Gate, the movement of inspectors and tax collectors, the way cargo and coin flows. As a result, it's easy for you to hustle a load of cargo ashore or see such a cargo onto a cooperative ship without attracting suspicion or taxation. You also know the movements of the Gray Wavers—the Flaming Fist harbor guards—and have a sense of how to operate the city's mechanized cranes.

You've had enough dealings with crooked soldiers that you can spot the behaviors common to corrupt guards and military officers a mile away. While awareness of such corruption doesn't equate to evidence of it, and your sense certainly isn't foolproof, your instinct proves a useful starting point when determining who might take a bribe, who might turn a blind eye to a crime, or who might have criminal connections. You can also use this sense to get a feeling about who might fulfill their duties strictly by the book.

You go where the angels tell you to go, and you do what they command you to do, to the best of your ability. If you enjoy some measure of independence, it's either because you have proven yourself capable of working without close supervision or because you're a rebellious sort who is willing to disobey orders now and face the consequences later.
As a soldier on the street, you are tasked with bringing dangerous threats like the Rakdos and the Gruul in line. You might contend with Rakdos performances gone horribly out of control, Gruul raids on outlying neighborhoods, shipments of rot-infested vegetation from the Golgari undercity, and violent uprisings among the guildless. At the same time, you might have to worry about Dimir spies infiltrating your leadership, overzealous or corrupt Azorius senators abusing the law at the expense of justice, Izzet experiments leveling city blocks, and Simic creations that break out of laboratories and wreak havoc through the Tenth District.

      <text>You are used to being in charge of the operation and your reputation for reliability has you on a short list when the job is critical. Experience has taught you to rely on your gut. Others recognize this and look to you for direction when a situation gets serious. You are able to identify the most defensible locations for camping. If you are part of a caravan outfit, you are able to attract two additional workers that are loyal to you based on your reputation. You have an excellent memory for maps and geography and can always determine your cardinal directions while traveling. Note: This feature is a variant of the Outlander feature.

      <text>d8 | Personality Trait
1 | Any group is only as strong as its weakest link. Everyone has to pull their own weight. 
2 | There's always someone out there trying to take what I've got. Always be vigilant.
3 | Anything can be learned if you have the right teacher. Most folks just need a chance.
4 | Early to bed and early to rise; this much at least is under my control.
5 | You can listen to me or don't and wish you had. Everyone ends up on one side of that fence.
6 | Eventually my hard work will be rewarded. Maybe that time has finally come.
7 | A strong ox or horse is more reliable than most people I've met.
8 | I never had time for books, but wish I had. I admire folks who have taken the time to learn.

d6 | Ideal
1 | Service. Using my talents to help others is the best way of helping myself. (Good)
2 | Selfish. What people don't know WILL hurt them, but why is that my problem? (Evil)
3 | Wanderer. I go where the road takes me. Sometimes that's a good thing... (Chaotic)
4 | Fittest. On the open road, the law of nature wins. Victims are the unprepared. (Lawful)
5 | Focused. I simply have a job to do, and I'm going to do it. (Neutral)
6 | Motivated. There's a reason I'm good at what I do, I pay attention to the details. (Any) 

d6 | Bond
1 | My brother has a farm In Elmwood and I've helped him and his neighbors move their goods to Mulmaster and other surrounding towns. Those are good people.
2 | A caravan I lead was attacked by bandits and many innocents died. I swear that I will avenge them by killing any bandits I encounter.
3 | The Soldiery are mostly good guys who understand the importance of protecting the roads. The City Watch is who you have to look out for. If they are inspecting your goods, get ready to pay a fine.
4 | The new commander of Southroad Tower, Capt. Holke, understands the importance of safe roads. He's hired me for several jobs and I'm grateful.
5 | There's always a road I haven't traveled before. I'm always looking for new places to explore.
6 | Wealth and power mean little without the freedom to go where and when you want.

d6 | Flaw

2 | I enjoy the open road. Underground and tight spaces make me very nervous.

4 | I am very prideful and have trouble admitting when I'm wrong.
5 | Once I decide on a course of action, I do not waiver.
6 | I like to explore, and my curiosity will sometimes get me into trouble.

      <text>You have always had a way with people. You know what makes them tick, you can tease out their hearts' desires after a few minutes of conversation, and with a few leading questions you can read like they were children's books. It's a useful talent, and one that you're perfectly willing to use for your advantage
You know what people want and you deliver, or rather, you promise to deliver. Common sense should steer people away from things that sound too good to be true, but common sense seems to be in short supply when you're around. The bottle of pink-colored liquid will surely cure that unseemly rash, this ointment–nothing more than a bit of fat with a sprinkle of silver dust–can restore youth and vigor, and there's a bridge in the city that just happens to be for sale. These marvels sound implausible, but you can make them sound like the real deal.

3 | Somewhere out there, I have a child who doesn't know me. I'm making the world better for him or her.

Instead, your service to your hometown was to help police its populace, protecting the citizenry from lawbreakers and malefactors of every stripe.
You might have been part of the City Watch of Waterdeep, the baton-wielding police force of the City of Splendors, protecting the common folk from thieves and rowdy nobility alike. Or you might have been one of the valiant defenders of Silverymoon, a member of the Silverwatch or even one of the magic-wielding Spellguard.
Perhaps you hail from Neverwinter and have served as one of its Wintershield watchmen, the newly founded branch of guards who vow to keep safe the City of Skilled Hands.
Even if you're not city-born or city-bred, this background can describe your early years as a member of law enforcement. Most settlements of any size have their own constables and police forces, and even smaller communities have sheriffs and bailiffs who stand ready to protect their community.

For years you labored under a dwarf master of the craft, enduring long hours and dismissive, sour-tempered treatment in order to gain the fine skills you possess today.
You are most likely a dwarf, but not necessarily—particularly in the North, the shield dwarf clans learned long ago that only proud fools who are more concerned for their egos than their craft turn away promising apprentices, even those of other races. If you aren't a dwarf, however, you have taken a solemn oath never to take on an apprentice in the craft: it is not for nondwarves to pass on the skills of Moradin's favored children. You would have no difficulty, however, finding a dwarf master who was willing to receive potential apprentices who came with your recommendation.

      <text>As a child, you were inquisitive when your playmates were possessive or raucous. In your formative years, you found your way to one of Faerûn's great institutes of learning, where you were apprenticed and taught that knowledge is a more valuable treasure than gold or gems. Now you are ready to leave your home—not to abandon it, but to quest for new lore to add to its storehouse of knowledge.
The most well known of Faerûn's fonts of knowledge is Candlekeep. The great library is always in need of workers and attendants, some of whom rise through the ranks to assume roles of greater responsibility and prominence. You might be one of Candlekeep's own, dedicated to the curatorship of what is likely the most complete body of lore and history in all the world.
Perhaps instead you were taken in by the scholars of the Vault of the Sages or the Map House in Silverymoon, and now you have struck out to increase your knowledge and to make yourself available to help those in other places who seek your expertise. You might be one of the few who aid Herald's Holdfast, helping to catalogue and maintain records of the information that arrives daily from across Faerûn.

        <name>Specialty</name>
      <text>There are many kinds of criminals, and within a thieves' guild or similar criminal organization, individual members have particular specialties. Even criminals who operate outside of such organizations have strong preferences for certain kinds of crimes over others. Choose the role you played in your criminal life, or roll on the table below.
d8 | Specialty
1 | Blackmailer

        <name>Suggested Characteristics</name>
      <text>Criminals might seem like villains on the surface, and many of them are villainous to the core. But some have an abundance of endearing, if not redeeming, characteristics. There might be honor among thieves, but criminals rarely show any respect for law or authority.
d8 | Personality Trait
1 | I always have a plan for when things go wrong.
2 | I am always calm, no matter what the situation. I never raise my voice or let my emotions control me.
3 | The first thing I do in a new place is note the locations of everything valuable—or where such things could be hidden.
4 | I would rather make a new friend than a new enemy.
5 | I am incredibly slow to trust. Those who seem the fairest often have the most to hide.
6 | I don't pay attention to the risks in a situation. Never tell me the odds.
7 | The best way to get me to do something is to tell me I can't do it.
8 | I blow up at the slightest insult.

d6 | Ideal
1 | Honor. I don't steal from others in the trade. (Lawful)
2 | Freedom. Chains are meant to be broken, as are those who would forge them. (Chaotic)
3 | Charity. I steal from the wealthy so that I can help people in need. (Good)
4 | Greed. I will do whatever it takes to become wealthy. (Evil)
5 | People. I'm loyal to my friends, not to any ideals, and everyone else can take a trip down the Styx for all I care. (Neutral)
6 | Redemption. There's a spark of good in everyone. (Good)

d6 | Bond
1 | I'm trying to pay off an old debt I owe to a generous benefactor.
2 | My ill-gotten gains go to support my family.
3 | Something important was taken from me, and I aim to steal it back.
4 | I will become the greatest thief that ever lived.
5 | I'm guilty of a terrible crime. I hope I can redeem myself for it.
6 | Someone I loved died because of a mistake I made. That will never happen again.

d6 | Flaw
1 | When I see something valuable, I can't think about anything but how to steal it.
2 | When faced with a choice between money and my friends, I usually choose the money.
3 | If there's a plan, I'll forget it. If I don't forget it, I'll ignore it.
4 | I have a 'tell' that reveals when I'm lying.
5 | I turn tail and run when things look bad.
6 | An innocent person is in prison for a crime that I committed. I'm okay with that.

    <trait>
        <name>Description</name>
      <text>You're a spy. Secrets and misinformation are your stock in trade. You skulk in the shadows, infiltrate other guilds, and steal the most precious secrets, whether they're written in locked journals or hidden away in someone's mind. Even you might not be aware of all the reasons behind the missions you carry out. Sometimes a mission's sole purpose is to conceal the motivation behind another strike performed in a different part of the city, or simply to spread fear.
As part of your covert work for House Dimir, you maintain a false identity as a member of another guild. You can choose your secondary guild or roll to determine it randomly. This secondary guild membership determines a portion of your starting equipment and is also where most of your contacts come from. You infiltrate your secondary guild to learn its secrets, keep tabs on its activities, or perhaps undermine it from within.
• Skill Proficiencies: Deception, Stealth
• Tool Proficiencies: Disguise kit
• Languages: One of your choice
• Equipment: A Dimir insignia, three small knives, a set of dark-colored common clothes, and the starting equipment of the background described in this chapter for your secondary guild

        <name>Feature: False Identity</name>
      <text>You have more than one identity. The one you wear most of the time makes you appear to be a member of a guild other than House Dimir. You have documentation, established acquaintances, and disguises that allow you to assume that persona and fit into the secondary guild.
Whenever you choose, you can drop this identity and blend into the guildless masses of the city.
Consider why you're embedded in the secondary guild. Create a story with your DM, inspired by rolling on the following table or choosing a reason that suits you.
d8 | Reason for Infiltration
1 | My parents belong to this guild, and I let them think I'm following in their footsteps.
2 | I've been assigned to track this guild's activities.
3 | I've been assigned to get close to an individual in this guild and learn their secrets.
4 | I've been assigned to recruit a new Dimir spy from the ranks of this guild.
5 | I was a member of this guild before the Dimir recruited me.
6 | I don't like what this guild stands for and want to destroy it from within.
7 | I secretly wish I could leave the Dimir and join this guild, but there is no escaping the Dimir.
8 | I chose this guild at random or on a lark.

        <name>Dimir Guild Spells</name>
      <text>Prerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature
For you, the spells on the Dimir Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)
Dimir Guild Spells
Spell Level | Spells
Cantrip | encode thoughts, mage hand
1st | disguise self, sleep
2nd | detect thoughts, pass without trace
3rd | gaseous form, meld into stone, nondetection
4th | arcane eye, freedom of movement
5th | modify memory

Your magic is meant to be subtle and undetectable, but it might pull shadows or clouds of mist around you as you cast your spells. Using the encode thoughts cantrip described below, you can turn a creature's thoughts (including your own) into a thought strand that others can potentially read, share, or steal. These thought strands are treated as valuable currency among the Dimir.

Personality Traits
d8 | Personality Trait
1 | I'm good at hiding my true thoughts and feelings.
2 | When I'm in doubt about revealing something, I assume it's a secret, and I don't share it.
3 | I like to sound mysterious, because wisdom hidden grows deeper with time.
4 | I have no patience with people who get in my way.
5 | I love hearing about other people's nightmares.
6 | Combat is meant to be quick, clean, and one-sided.
7 | I like to stick to the shadows.
8 | I never show my anger. I just plot my revenge.

Ideals
d6 | Ideal
1 | Guild. My true guild is all that really matters. (Any)
2 | Control. I like pulling the strings. (Lawful)
3 | Secrets. I collect secrets and never reveal them. (Any)
4 | Knowledge. I want to know as much as I can about this city and how it works. (Any)
5 | Independence. I value the freedom to pursue my own goals without interference. (Chaotic)
6 | Nihilism. I don't believe in anything, and anyone who does is a fool. (Neutral)

Bonds
d6 | Bond
1 | I discovered a secret I can't let anyone else uncover—including my guild superiors.
2 | I formed a close friendship or romance with someone in the guild I'm infiltrating.
3 | The Dimir agent who recruited me was unmasked and killed. My revenge on the killers will be thorough and painful.
4 | I spend as much time as I can in the Ismeri Library because I'm certain an information hub operates behind its facade. I want its secrets!
5 | I'm utterly loyal to my superior in the guild, more than to the guild or its guildmaster.
6 | Someone has discovered my true identity.

Flaws
d6 | Flaw
1 | I like secrets so much that I'm reluctant to share details of a plan even with those who need to know.
2 | I would let my friends die rather than reveal my true identity.
3 | I have trouble trusting anyone but myself.
4 | I have a particular vice that puts all my secrets at risk if I'm not careful.
5 | I'm pretty sure I've done something horrible that I can't remember because of the guild's mind magic.
6 | I put too much trust in the people who give me orders.

        <name>Contacts</name>
      <text>As an agent of House Dimir working undercover, you have limited contacts within your guild. Your relationships within your secondary guild, in the guise of your false identity, are usually more extensive.
Roll once on the Dimir Contacts table, giving you an ally who serves as your contact in Dimir. Then roll twice on the table for your secondary guild. The first roll gives you an ally there, and the second roll gives you a rival.
Dimir Contacts
d8 | Contact
1 | I know a Dimir courier who relays messages to me from someone higher up the chain of command.
2 | I get orders from a shapeshifter I recognize only through a series of code phrases we exchange.
3 | An ostentatiously wealthy vampire is my secret guild superior, summoning me to a luxurious estate by means of coded messages.
4 | I have never met my guild contact, but I receive telepathic messages, usually in my dreams.
5 | I've never met my guild contact, but I get coded messages from a pattern of street lights and graffiti.
6 | I didn't discover the identity of my guild contact until after we had begun a romantic relationship.
7 | My superior maintains an elaborate identity as a young street urchin... unless it's all a lie, and I'm being sent on ridiculous missions by a twisted child.
8 | My sibling and I both get telepathic orders from a mysterious contact, and I'm starting to question the authenticity of my sibling's orders.

        <name>How Do I Fit In?</name>
      <text>As a Dimir adventurer, you are a member of the guild's network of spies, thieves, assassins, and mind mages that lurks behind the facade of the public guild. On the surface, House Dimir presents the appearance of a network of couriers, investigators, media reporters, and archivists, dealing in information and spreading news. But you and your peers trade in secrets. You use secret symbols, runes, and signals to surreptitiously communicate with other Dimir agents, often in plain sight.
Like any good spy, you have multiple identities: your true face as an agent of House Dimir; a guildless identity; and a role as a member of another guild. Within that secondary guild, you might already be on a mission for House Dimir, assigned to spy on the guild, collect information about a person, or recruit another spy from the ranks of the guild. Or that guild could be a launching point for your real mission. Perhaps, for example, you were ordered to infiltrate the Azorius in hopes of gaining access to a notorious inmate in an Azorius prison.

      <text>Even in the carefully constructed and curated city-state of Naktamun, and in the presence of the five gods, some people rebel against the doctrines of the God-Pharaoh. They don't challenge the existence of the gods, of course, for those gods are visible nearly every day in the streets of the city. Nor do they question the fact of life after death, which is plain to see in the anointed mummies that surround them, as well as the marauding mummies outside the Hekma. Rather, these dissenters simply refuse to follow the ordained course of life that leads to the glorious afterlife.
Some dissenters are spurred by fear, not wanting to subject themselves to a violent death in the trials (or in training for the trials). Some are moved by conscience, unwilling to kill their crop-mates in the trials. For while they cannot deny that the gods exist, they can deny that the gods are just—and can fight to prove that the dictates of an unjust god need not be obeyed. Some believe that one god (probably Bontu) has corrupted the process of the trials and the path to the afterlife. Others correctly intuit that the God-Pharaoh did not actually have the people's best interests in mind when he ordered their society.
A character who is identified as a dissenter loses the benefit of the initiate's or vizier's background feature. In its place, the character gains the Shelter of Dissenters feature.

        <name>Feature: Dragonscarred</name>
      <text>Over a period of several months you were subject to magical and mundane torture at the claws of Vorgansharaxse and his minions. These experiments have left you horribly disfigured but mark you as a survivor of the Maimed Virulence. This affords you a measure of fame and notoriety, for those who know of your harrowing ordeal are keen to hear the tale personally but makes it difficult to disguise your appearance and hide from prying eyes.
You can parlay this attention into access to people and places you might not otherwise have, for you and your companions. Nobles, scholars, mages, and those who seek to ferret out the secrets of the Maimed Virulence would all be keen to hear your tale of survival, and learn what secrets (if any) you might possess, and/or study your affliction with great interest. However, you fear that your afflictions are not completely mundane and that the Maimed Virulence may as yet have some nefarious reason for allowing your escape, as your scars burn with acidic fury and seem to writhe beneath your skin at times.

At such a place, you receive free lodging and food of a modest or comfortable standard (depending on the quality of the establishment), as long as you perform each night. In addition, your performance makes you something of a local figure. When strangers recognize you in a town where you have performed, they typically take a liking to you.

Whether due to your class, your people, your family, or your sins, something about you prevents you from effectively pursuing the path you've chosen. Even so, that doesn't stop you. You've left your old face behind, taking on a new persona, becoming something more.
Characters with the faceless background don a disguise—literally or otherwise—as they adventure. This persona might be dramatic or subtle. In a way, though, many characters have such larger than life personalities. Therefore, this background largely focuses on detailing the hero behind the mask.

      <text>Most of your fellow adventurers and the world know you as your persona. Those who seek to learn more about you—your weaknesses, your origins, your purpose—find themselves stymied by your disguise. Upon donning a disguise and behaving as your persona, you are unidentifiable as your true self. By removing your disguise and revealing your true face, you are no longer identifiable as your persona. This allows you to change appearances between your two personalities as often as you wish, using one to hide the other or serve as convenient camouflage. However, should someone realize the connection between your persona and your true self, your deception might lose its effectiveness.

      <text>A faceless character usually plays their persona—the hero or extraordinary person they are every day. That's all a facade, though, or a part of them expressed to an extreme. To define a persona, feel free to choose characteristics from other backgrounds, particularly folk hero, hermit, or noble. For the person behind the persona, the one who truly strives to be faceless, consider a distinct set of faceless characteristics. As a result, those with this background have two sets of characteristics, one for their persona, and one for their faceless selves.

      <text>Many organizations active in the North and across the face of Faerûn aren't bound by strictures of geography. These factions pursue their agendas without regard for political boundaries, and their members operate anywhere the organization deems necessary. These groups employ listeners, rumormongers, smugglers, sellswords, cache-holders (people who guard caches of wealth or magic for use by the faction's operatives), haven keepers, and message drop minders, to name a few. At the core of every faction are those who don't merely fulfill a small function for that organization, but who serve as its hands, head, and heart.
As a prelude to your adventuring career (and in preparation for it), you served as an agent of a particular faction in Faerûn. You might have operated openly or secretly, depending on the faction and its goals, as well as how those goals mesh with your own. Becoming an adventurer doesn't necessarily require you to relinquish membership in your faction (though you can choose to do so), and it might enhance your status in the faction.

You aren't one of those folk.
You are from a distant place, one so remote that few of the common folk in the North realize that it exists, and chances are good that even if some people you meet have heard of your homeland, they know merely the name and perhaps a few outrageous stories. You have come to this part of Faerûn for your own reasons, which you might or might not choose to share.
Although you will undoubtedly find some of this land's ways to be strange and discomfiting, you can also be sure that some things its people take for granted will be to you new wonders that you've never laid eyes on before. By the same token, you're a person of interest, for good or ill, to those around you almost anywhere you go.

2 | Fate. Whatever happens is fated, regardless of any planning or striving. (Lawful)
3 | Bravery. If you want to succeed, you have to take risks. (Chaotic)

5 | Reliability. When I was in need, I was able to rely on others. Now I want to be the one others rely on. (Good)

3 | The person who saved me from my gambling addiction is the only reason I'm alive today.
4 | A patron once fronted me money in exchange for a percentage of my winnings. I owe them a debt of gratitude. And a lot of cash.
5 | A criminal syndicate I once played for isn't happy I left the game, and its enforcers are looking for me.
6 | Urchins once helped me find marks for my games. Now I'm driven to help them escape the streets.

d6 | Flaw
1 | I don't know when to quit. Especially when everyone else is telling me to.

      <text>You are a member of a teeming horde—one small part of a sprawling organism. Just as you are part of the swarm, the swarm is part of a larger ecosystem, a never-ending cycle of life, death, rot, and rebirth. You have spent your life in the slow churn of that ecosystem, in the dark places of the city where the messy parts of existence are on display. There is little squeamishness among the Golgari, no fear of death or taboo about the dead, just a fierce affirmation of the cycle.

Personality Traits

1 | Remember, I could kill you in your sleep. Or put centipedes in your bedroll.
2 | I like to remind people of their inevitable demise.
3 | Sometimes I give voice to the whispers of the rot, which I hear but no one else does.
4 | I do my best to discourage anyone from approaching or talking to me.
5 | I have accepted my death. Hence, I don't fear it.

Ideals
d6 | Ideal
1 | Guild. My guild is all that really matters. (Any)
2 | Stoicism. All of us are part of the cyclical march of nature, which will continue with or without us. (Neutral)
3 | Nature. The natural world is more important than the edifices of the city and civilization. (Neutral)

5 | Ambition. The time of Golgari ascendance is at hand, and I intend to have a prominent place in the new world order. (Evil)
6 | Live and Let Live. Meddling in the affairs of other guilds is a great way to get squashed like a bug. (Neutral)

Bonds

4 | I don't bother to couch my opinions in flattering words.

Golgari Contacts
d8 | Contact
1 | One of my parents is an elite assassin, a member of the Ochran.
2 | I learned combat from a kraul.
3 | I know a medusa who is stationed in the guildhall.
4 | I had a torrid romance with a spore druid responsible for a large rot farm.
5 | There's a troll in a remote area of the undercity who seems to find me interesting—and who knows more than you'd think.
6 | An elf lich is determined to see me become a lich someday, too.
7 | A medusa decided it would be more fun to recruit me into the guild than to kill me.

Non-Golgari Contacts
d10 | Contact

3 | I had a romance with a Dimir agent whom I still feed secrets to.
4 | Roll an additional Golgari contact; you can decide if the contact is an ally or a rival.
5 | I joined the Gruul in a battle against the Boros once, and the chief of that small clan thanks me for turning the tide.
6 | An Izzet scientist resents that I sold a scrapped invention I found in the sewer.
7 | My undercity explorations led me into an Orzhov vault, and a spirit thinks I stole something valuable.
8 | I found a baby beast and sold it to a Rakdos wrangler who remains grateful to me.
9 | A Selesnya druid and I share an interest in the same garden, and we have enjoyable arguments there.
10 | I regularly pick up refuse from beneath a Simic laboratory, and sometimes I talk to the researcher who dumps it there.

      </trait>
    <trait>
        <name>How Do I Fit In?</name>
      <text>As part of the Golgari Swarm, you are a specialized instrument of the greater body. Your orders, when you have such, come from the guildmaster by way of his chancellors, who carry his messages throughout the guild. The swarm relies on you to advance the greater good by protecting some part, however small, of its teeming existence. That responsibility doesn't mean you're indispensable; your eventual death is part of your purpose and function, too, and you'll be replaced even as your body provides nutrients to further the swarm's growth.
A classic adventuring role for a member of the Golgari involves crawling through dungeon-like environments—the sewers and ancient vaults of the undercity—in search of treasures left behind by the dead. Sometimes you might be sent to find a specific item believed lost in a dangerous part of the undercity. At other times, you could be asked to collect samples of a specific fungus, retrieve a body floating in the muck of the sewers, or bring back whatever booty you can to help fill the swarm's coffers.
You might gain enough renown to become a member of the Ochran, assigned to a variety of tasks concerning thievery, assassination, or the protection of important figures in your guild. You might steal something because the guild needs it, or because its loss will bring harm to another guild, hastening that group's decline. You could be assigned to kill an outspoken and active enemy of the Golgari, such as an overzealous Boros captain whose raids into the undercity have approached dangerously close to the swarm's inner sanctum. Or you could serve as a bodyguard to one of Guildmaster Jarad's high chancellors, escorting this figure through the undercity while being ready to intervene at a moment's notice if things go wrong.
The shamans of the Golgari use their magic to accelerate the cycle of decay and regrowth. You might be sent to spread spores throughout an area that the Golgari want to claim as their territory or to convince the inhabitants of such a territory to abandon it. You might also contend with the ever-present threat of hostile monsters encroaching into Golgari-controlled regions.

      <text>The Golden Grin began in the far-off land of Tal'Dorei, trading secret messages through a network of bards and minstrels to undermine an iron-fisted king's authoritarian rule. Today, Tal'Dorei is a relatively peaceful republic, and some Grinners have grown restless while waiting for tyranny to raise its ugly head again. A contingent of such Grinners traveled to the Menagerie Coast and set up a network of secret bases in the cities of the Clovis Concord, from which they are presently working their way into the highest echelons of the Dwendalian Empire.
You are a Grinner. Your goals are to spread freedom and inspire hope—or, in time, revolution—in the hearts of the oppressed.

2 | Blow Fire Down the Coast. A rowdy fighting song from the Clovis Concord, this ditty talks of blasting up pirate ships. Use it to encourage battle.
3 | Hush! Onward Come the Dragons. This Tal'Dorei folk song recounts the terror in the days after the invasion of the red dragon called the Cinder King. Use it to encourage caution in speech and deed.
4 | Let the Sword Grow Rust. An antiwar anthem from Marquet, this song has uncertain origins. Use it to help quell violent encounters.
5 | Drink Deep, Li'l Hummingbird. A drinking rondo from the Menagerie Coast, this song tells the tale of a young person who drinks so heavily that they awaken to find they've stowed away on a ship. Use it to encourage alertness in social situations.
6 | Dirge for the Emerald Fire. This elven song supposedly has thousands of obscure verses. Use the first two verses to spread news of death or defeat.

      <text>Like every Grinner, you know how to find a hideout. In any city of 10,000 people or more on the Menagerie Coast or in the lands of the Dwendalian Empire, you can play the "Ballad of the Grinning Fool" in a major tavern or inn. A member of the Golden Grin will find you and give shelter to you and any companions you vouch for. This shelter might be discontinued if it becomes too dangerous to hide you, at the DM's discretion.
This feature must be used with caution, for not all who know the ballad are your friends. Some are traitors, counterspies, or agents of tyranny.

      <text>Grinners are trained in the art of secrecy and innuendo, and are skilled at hiding in plain sight by being the loudest and brightest person in the room.

      <text>In service of a simple goal, you have a simple part to play: Fight. Unleash your rage. Flatten buildings and defeat those who stand in your way. Be Gruul, in your own way.
You will frequently be summoned to participate in a raid your clan is launching against the city or against a group of its defenders. Your clan leader might also send you on a special mission, though it would almost certainly still qualify as a raid. You might join a small group of Gruul warriors on a dangerous charge deep into the settled streets to plunder a certain location, retrieve an item stolen from your clan, or assault a Boros garrison.
Sometimes your objective might be more esoteric. With prophecies of the return of Ilharg the Raze-Boar spreading like wildfire among the Gruul druids, you might be asked to carry out some task that the druids believe will speed his coming. Such a task might involve collecting a sacred relic held in an Orzhov vault or collecting sacrifices for a grand ceremony in the Raze-Boar's honor.

        <name>Feature: Guild Membership</name>
      <text>As an established and respected member of a guild, you can rely on certain benefits that membership provides. Your fellow guild members will provide you with lodging and food if necessary, and pay for your funeral if needed. In some cities and towns, a guildhall offers a central place to meet other members of your profession, which can be a good place to meet potential patrons, allies, or hirelings.
Guilds often wield tremendous political power. If you are accused of a crime, your guild will support you if a good case can be made for your innocence or the crime is justifiable. You can also gain access to powerful political figures through the guild, if you are a member in good standing. Such connections might require the donation of money or magic items to the guild's coffers.
You must pay dues of 5 gp per month to the guild. If you miss payments, you must make up back dues to remain in the guild's good graces.

However, your guild might instead be a loose network of artisans who each work in a different village within a larger realm. Work with your DM to determine the nature of your guild. You can select your guild business from the Guild Business table or roll randomly.

      <text>Hillsfar is the City of Trade. However, the Great Law of Trade only protects "legitimate" trade, trade that passes through the city's sole gate, which the Red Plumes monitor and tax. And the Great Law of Humanity banishes non-humans from the city altogether. The two Great Laws create great demand and great risk for smugglers, who shepherd illicit goods and non-humans into and out of the city by secret routes. The Rogues Guild tightly controls all of this activity, taking its cut from sanctioned jobs and exacting punishment for independent jobs.
Perhaps you trafficked Dragon's Breath (a brandy-like liquor) to avoid tariffs or contraband to avoid seizure, or maybe you are a human who sympathizes with the non-humans and worked as part of the network of secret routes and safe houses that helps them pass through Hillsfar. Either way, you have contacts in the smuggling community who can help you slip into and out of the city unnoticed, for a price.

The two Great Laws create great demand and great risk for smugglers, who shepherd illicit goods and non-humans into and out of the city by secret routes. The Rogues Guild tightly controls all of this activity, taking its cut from sanctioned jobs and exacting punishment for independent jobs.
Perhaps you trafficked Dragon's Breath (a brandy-like liquor) to avoid tariffs or contraband to avoid seizure, or maybe you are a human who sympathizes with the non-humans and worked as part of the network of secret routes and safe houses that helps them pass through Hillsfar. Either way, you have contacts in the smuggling community who can help you slip into and out of the city unnoticed, for a price.

        <name>Feature: Secret Passage</name>
      <text>You can call on your contacts within the smuggling community to secure secret passage into or out of Hillsfar for yourself and your adventuring companions, no questions asked, and no Red Plume entanglements. Because you're calling in a favor, you can't be certain they will be able to help on your timetable or at all. Your Dungeon Master will determine whether you can be smuggled into or out of the city. In return for your passage, you and your companions may owe the Rouges Guild a favor and/or may have to pay bribes. Note: This feature is a variant of the Sailor feature.

Work with your Dungeon Master to come up with details: Why is your inheritance so important, and what is its full story? You might prefer for the DM to invent these details as part of the game, allowing you to learn more about your inheritance as your character does.
The Dungeon Master is free to use your inheritance as a story hook, sending you on quests to learn more about its history or true nature, or confronting you with foes who want to claim it for themselves or prevent you from learning what you seek. The DM also determines the properties of your inheritance and how they figure into the item's history and importance. For instance, the object might be a minor magic item, or one that begins with a modest ability and increases in potency with the passage of time. Or, the true nature of your inheritance might not be apparent at first and is revealed only when certain conditions are met.
When you begin your adventuring career, you can decide whether to tell your companions about your inheritance right away. Rather than attracting attention to yourself, you might want to keep your inheritance a secret until you learn more about what it means to you and what it can do for you.

      <text>You are an initiate, on the path to completing the trials of the five gods in the hope of earning a glorified death in the final Trial of Zeal. Some combination of your natural aptitude, your crop's needs, and your teachers' assessment while you were an acolyte led you to focus your training in one particular area of specialization—hand-to-hand combat, long-range combat, or spellcasting. But only a well-rounded initiate can be called truly worthy of the afterlife.
If you are a hand-to-hand specialist, consider the barbarian, fighter, monk, paladin, or rogue classes. As a long-range combat specialist, you might be a fighter, a ranger, or a rogue. If you are a spellcasting specialist, you might be a bard, sorcerer, or wizard. And beyond this initial choice, you might consider multiclassing or using feats to round out your skills in all three areas.

        <name>Feature: Trials of the Five Gods</name>
      <text>Your life is oriented around your participation in the five trials that will determine your worthiness in the afterlife. While you prepare for and undergo those trials, you have constant access to training. A comfortable place to live and regular meals are provided to you by servitor mummies (the anointed) under the supervision of viziers. You can enjoy these benefits only as long as you obey the societal norms of Naktamun—training for the trials (with or without your crop), obeying the orders of the gods, and following the instructions of their viziers. If you violate these norms, you risk being treated as a dissenter. See "Trials of the Five Gods" for more information about undertaking the trials and their rewards.
The five gods are the effective rulers of Amonkhet. They are not the creators of the plane, but they are its stewards while the people of Naktamun await the return of the God-Pharaoh. The five gods believe they were created by the God-Pharaoh, who charged them with teaching the people the ways of the God-Pharaoh, and with protecting them until he comes.
The five gods embody the five virtues the God-Pharaoh wishes to cultivate in those who will become his Eternals in the afterlife. Each god is responsible for modeling and teaching one of those virtues to the acolytes and initiates of Naktamun, and then testing those initiates to ensure that they have mastered their teachings. Thus, they are present during the acolytes' first lessons, during the Ceremony of Measuring, during the initiates' intense training, and at each of the trials that are part of an initiate's journey.
In the absence of the God-Pharaoh, only the gods can determine whether initiates have proven themselves worthy of the glory of the afterlife. The gods in turn prove their own worthiness by executing their duties infallibly. They make the trials as challenging as possible to ensure that only the most worthy are selected.

The afterlife might be a constant presence in every initiate's mind, but it is the culmination of a life well-lived—not a replacement for it.

      <text>Historically, inquisitors were cathar detectives who investigated crimes both mundane and supernatural. They were known for traveling to remote parishes plagued by unexplained murders, and for exposing werewolves living among normal humans. During Avacyn's absence, when the archangel was trapped within the demonic prison known as the Helvault, the inquisitors led a series of brutal forays into Kessig and the Gavony Moorland. They executed suspected lycanthropes with little or no proof, and punished accused heretics in unsanctioned trials. With Avacyn's madness, this savage form of inquisition has become the norm, and inquisitors who still pry into dark mysteries have become a minority.

      <text>The popular conception of the Izzet League is based on mad inventions, dangerous experiments, and explosive blasts. Much of that perception is accurate, but the league is also involved with mundane tasks of construction and architecture—primarily in crafting the infrastructure that allows Ravnicans to enjoy running water, levitating platforms, and other magical and technological wonders.
You have a basic knowledge of the structure of buildings, including the stuff behind the walls. You can also find blueprints of a specific building in order to learn the details of its construction.

Your spells tend to be loud, flashy, or explosive, even when the effect is unremarkable. For example, when you open the portal of a rope trick spell, the portal might be outlined by harmless, showy sparkles.
If you use an arcane focus, it probably takes the form of an intricate device that could include metal gauntlets, glass canisters, copper tubing, and leather straps attaching it to your body. The mizzium apparatus described in chapter 5 is a magical version of this gear.
The chaos bolt spell is a favorite of Izzet spellcasters because of its unpredictable nature.

2 | I'll never forget the laboratory where I learned my skills, or the other attendants who learned alongside me.
3 | I'm convinced it was sabotage that destroyed my first laboratory and killed many of my friends, and I seek revenge against whoever did it.
4 | I have the schematics for an invention that I hope to build one day, once I have the necessary resources.
5 | A fellow student and I are racing to solve the same scientific puzzle.
6 | I would do anything the guildmaster told me to do.

Flaws
d6 | Flaw
1 | If there's a plan, I'll probably forget it. If I don't forget it, I'll probably ignore it.
2 | I get bored easily, and if nothing is happening I'll make something happen.
3 | Nothing is ever simple, and if it seems simple, I'll find a way to make it complicated.
4 | I tend to ignore sleep for days when I'm conducting research, often at the expense of my own health and safety.
5 | I'm convinced there's not a soul in Ravnica, except maybe the great Niv-Mizzet, who can match my boundless intellect.
6 | I'm incapable of admitting a flaw in my logic.

Roll twice on the Izzet Contacts table (for an ally and a rival) and once on the Non-Izzet Contacts table.
Izzet Contacts

7 | As an attendant, I had a fierce rivalry with another attendant for our supervisor's attention.
8 | The guildmaster, Niv-Mizzet, took note of one of my experiments!

Non-Izzet Contacts
d10 | Contact
1 | An Azorius inspector seems interested in my work.
2 | I was ready to join the Boros before I decided on Izzet, and I sometimes still hear from the sergeant who tried to recruit me.
3 | One of my former assistants turned out to be a Dimir spy. We're not on friendly terms anymore, but we have a habit of running into each other.
4 | A Golgari assassin killed a bitter rival of mine, leaving me with conflicted feelings.
5 | I helped a minor Gruul chieftain acquire an Izzet weapon.
6 | Roll an additional Izzet contact; you can decide if the contact is an ally or a rival.
7 | An Orzhov banker financed my laboratory's current work and expects great returns.
8 | I have a cousin in the Cult of Rakdos, and we get along quite well.
9 | A former attendant from the same laboratory ran off to join the Selesnya, and we get into a big argument every time we run into each other.

Everyone's contribution matters, even if the Izzet know that some matter more than others.

    <trait>
        <name>Description</name>
      <text>You belong to an order of knights who have sworn oaths to achieve a certain goal. The nature of this goal depends on the order you serve, but in your eyes it is without question a vital and honorable endeavor. Faerûn has a wide variety of knightly orders, all of which have a similar outlook concerning their actions and responsibilities.
Though the term "knight" conjures ideas of mounted, heavily armored warriors of noble blood, most knightly orders in Faerûn don't restrict their membership to such individuals. The goals and philosophies of the order are more important than the gear and fighting style of its members, and so most of these orders aren't limited to fighting types, but are open to all sorts of folk who are willing to battle and die for the order's cause.
The "Knightly Orders of Faerûn" sidebar details several of the orders that are active at present and is designed to help inform your decision about which group you owe allegiance to.
• Skill Proficiencies: Persuasion, plus one from among Arcana, History, Nature, and Religion, as appropriate for your order
• Tool Proficiencies: Your choice of a gaming set or a musical instrument
• Languages: Any one of your choice
• Equipment: One set of traveler's clothes, a signet, banner, or seal representing your place or rank in the order, and a pouch containing 10 gp

        <name>Knightly Orders of Faerûn</name>
      <text>Many who rightfully call themselves "knight" earn that title as part of an order in service to a deity, such as Kelemvor's Eternal Order or Mystra's Knights of the Mystic Fire. Other knightly orders serve a government, royal family, or are the elite military of a feudal state, such as the brutal Warlock Knights of Vaasa. Other knighthoods are secular and nongovernmental organizations of warriors who follow a particular philosophy, or consider themselves a kind of extended family, similar to an order of monks. Although there are organizations, such as the Knights of the Shield, that use the trappings of knighthood without necessarily being warriors, most folk of Faerûn who hear the word "knight" think of a mounted warrior in armor beholden to a code. Below are a few knightly organizations.

        <name>Feature: Knightly Regard</name>
      <text>You receive shelter and succor from members of your knightly order and those who are sympathetic to its aims. If your order is a religious one, you can gain aid from temples and other religious communities of your deity. Knights of civic orders can get help from the community—whether a lone settlement or a great nation—that they serve, and knights of philosophical orders can find help from those they have aided in pursuit of their ideals, and those who share their ideals.
This help comes in the form of shelter and meals, and healing when appropriate, as well as occasionally risky assistance, such as a band of local citizens rallying to aid a sorely pressed knight, or those who support the order helping to smuggle a knight out of town when he or she is being hunted unjustly.

Your bond almost always involves the order to which you belong (or at least key members of it), and it is highly unusual for a knight's ideal not to reflect the agenda, sentiment, or philosophy of one's order.

You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.
You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your temple.

Work with your DM to come up with an appropriate title and determine how much authority that title carries. A noble title doesn't stand on its own—it's connected to an entire family, and whatever title you hold, you will pass it down to your own children. Not only do you need to determine your noble title, but you should also work with the DM to describe your family and their influence on you.
Is your family old and established, or was your title only recently bestowed? How much influence do they wield, and over what area? What kind of reputation does your family have among the other aristocrats of the region? How do the common people regard them?
What's your position in the family? Are you the heir to the head of the family? Have you already inherited the title? How do you feel about that responsibility? Or are you so far down the line of inheritance that no one cares what you do, as long as you don't embarrass the family? How does the head of your family feel about your adventuring career? Are you in your family's good graces, or shunned by the rest of your family?
Does your family have a coat of arms? An insignia you might wear on a signet ring? Particular colors you wear all the time? An animal you regard as a symbol of your line or even a spiritual member of the family?
These details help establish your family and your title as features of the world of the campaign.

        <name>Feature: Position of Privilege</name>
      <text>Thanks to your noble birth, people are inclined to think the best of you. You are welcome in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make every effort to accommodate you and avoid your displeasure, and other people of high birth treat you as a member of the same social sphere. You can secure an audience with a local noble if you need to.

        <name>Suggested Characteristics</name>
      <text>Nobles are born and raised to a very different lifestyle than most people ever experience, and their personalities reflect that upbringing. A noble title comes with a plethora of bonds—responsibilities to family, to other nobles (including the sovereign), to the people entrusted to the family's care, or even to the title itself. But this responsibility is often a good way to undermine a noble.

      <text>The prospect of immense wealth is the promise of membership in the Orzhov Syndicate. All of the guild's endeavors channel wealth from Ravnican society into the ranks of the Orzhov—and concentrates the spoils at the top of the hierarchy. As a functionary in that system, your best hope is to claim as much as possible of the money that passes through your hands on its way up, so that you can work your way into a more prominent position.
Regardless of your past and the wealth of your family, your initial status with the guild is near the bottom, until you have proven your value.

      <text>The structure of the Orzhov Syndicate means that you are always doing the bidding of someone higher up the ladder than you are. Ultimately, your role in the guild is defined by whatever the people (and spirits) above you decide for you.
For most of your career, you can expect to engage in some aspect of the day-to-day criminal operations of the guild. That can mean throwing your weight around to enforce the will of the guild or using religious authority to extort offerings from the people. But it can also mean doing various errands for your superiors, from bearing messages to carrying out assassinations.

      <text>Your experience with your local legal system has given you a firm knowledge of the ins and outs of that system. Even when the law is not on your side, you can use complex terms like ex injuria jus non oritur and cogitationis poenam nemo patitur to frighten people into thinking you know what you're talking about. With common folks who don't know any better, you might be able to intimidate or deceive to get favors or special treatment.

      <text>You're an entertainer at heart, a performer with a flair for the dramatic and a love of the spotlight. You've spent years honing your craft, mastering a demanding set of skills so you can perform them with panache and make them look easy. The wild applause, the screams of the crowds, the mayhem and terror spreading into the streets—this is what you live for.
You're also a member of a cult devoted to an ancient demon who delights in violence and chaos. It just so happens that Rakdos loves a good show, and your highest aspiration is to please the Defiler, the Lord of Riots, with your own performance.

      <text>People recognize you as a member of the Cult of Rakdos, and they're careful not to draw your anger or ridicule. You can get away with minor criminal offenses, such as refusing to pay for food at a restaurant or breaking down a door at a local shop, if no legal authorities witness the crime. Most people are too daunted by you to report your wrongdoing to the Azorius.

      <text>Prerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature
For you, the spells on the Rakdos Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)
Rakdos Guild Spells
Spell Level | Spells
Cantrip | fire bolt, vicious mockery
1st | burning hands, dissonant whispers, hellish rebuke
2nd | crown of madness, enthrall, flaming sphere
3rd | fear, haste
4th | confusion, wall of fire
5th | dominate person

Your magic often produces a flashy spectacle, wreathing you or your targets in a mixture of harmless flame and shadowy shapes. When you manipulate an opponent's mind, a flaming symbol of Rakdos might momentarily appear like a mask over the target's face.

        <name>Contacts</name>
      <text>The Cult of Rakdos is anything but organized. Individuals frequently move from one performance troupe to another. Almost all members of the cult know former castmates now in different troupes, which allows for the possibility of a widespread network of contacts.
Roll twice on the Rakdos Contacts table (for an ally and a rival) and once on the Non-Rakdos Contacts table.
Rakdos Contacts
d8 | Contact
1 | I was part of a two-person act until my former partner moved to a different troupe.
2 | My sibling and I ran away from home and joined the Cult of Rakdos together. We're very close.
3 | A childhood friend of mine is an attendant in Rix Maadi, the Rakdos guildhall.
4 | My parents brought me into the guild and taught me my trade.
5 | There's a lesser demon in the cult who thinks he owes me a favor, and who am I to argue?
6 | The master of ceremonies in my troupe is well connected with other troupes.
7 | I had a romance with a pain artist in another troupe.
8 | Rakdos himself has witnessed me perform.

Non-Rakdos Contacts
d10 | Contact
1 | I know an Azorius elocutor who has a very amusing dark side.
2 | A Boros captain really wants to "redeem" me.
3 | I think a member of my troupe is a Dimir agent.
4 | I once convinced a Golgari medusa to participate in a show. We've been on good terms ever since.
5 | I came from the Gruul and still have relatives there.
6 | An Izzet technician provides pyrotechnics for my performances.
7 | An Orzhov oligarch has taken an interest in my career, like a patron of the arts.
8 | Roll an additional Rakdos contact; you can decide if the contact is an ally or a rival.
9 | A Selesnya healer attends my performances regularly.
10 | A Simic biomancer provides mutant monsters to add a taste of the bizarre to our shows.

        <name>How Do I Fit In?</name>
      <text>The Cult of Rakdos encourages independent action on the part of its members. Its goal is fomenting chaos, and it firmly believes in putting its own house in disorder before carrying that mission into the larger city. So your role is to execute your vision of grand satire and disruptive performance art, as you aspire to outdo your guild mates and attract the attention of Rakdos himself.
You work as part of a troupe, with your artistic talents used in service to a ringmaster's vision. But your performance is your own, and no one expects you to follow a script. In fact, if you go through a performance without doing something you haven't done before, you're clearly not trying hard enough.

      <text>Even though you are a non-human, despite Hillfar's Great Law of Humanity, you continue to live in the City of Trade. You do so by maintaining a secret identity, forging documents, and wearing a disguise. Few, if any, know you aren't human. If you're a halfling or gnome, you pass as a little person or a child. If you're a half-elf, half-orc, or genasi, you disguise your non-human features. Other races use a combination of disguise and concealing clothing to hide. Your reasons for doing so are your own.

      <text>You are a member of a blessed community, built on the ideals of harmony. Here, nature and civilization coexist peacefully, living and growing in accordance with the will of the Worldsoul, Mat'Selesnya. As a member of the Selesnya Conclave, you are surrounded by people and other creatures who share your worldview and your longing for deeper spiritual communion with the world, and you have a fervent desire to share the joy you have experienced with Ravnica. Along with the rest of the conclave, you are committed to resisting the ambitions of the other guilds—with military force if necessary.

      <text>As a member of the Selesnya Conclave, you can count on your guild mates to provide shelter and aid. You and your companions can find a place to hide or rest in any Selesnya enclave in the city, unless you have proven to be a danger to them. The members of the enclave will shield you from the law or anyone else searching for you, though they will not risk their lives in this effort.
In addition, as a guild member you can receive free healing and care at a Selesnya enclave, though you must provide any material components needed for spells.

For you, the spells on the Selesnya Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)
Selesnya Guild Spells

Members of the Selesnya Conclave refer to their magic as "doruvati," a Sylvan word meaning "gift." When you use these gifts of Mat'Selesnya, graceful swirls of green and silver light dance in the air around you, and phantasmal green leaves might waft through the air. A sensation of gentle warmth and the smell of spring flowers or autumn leaves might accompany your spells.

        <name>Contacts</name>
      <text>The Selesnya Conclave is all about connections, so its members cultivate contacts throughout the guild. The guild also engages in energetic recruitment to draw converts from other guilds, and often these new guild members maintain friendships with former guild mates.

        <name>How Do I Fit In?</name>
      <text>Although the guild teaches the importance of subjugating the individual will to the good of the conclave, it also celebrates the diversity of individuals, in the same sense that a field that produces different crops is healthier than one that yields a single crop. That principle applies to your skills as an adventurer. As long as your efforts are directed toward advancing the goals of the guild rather than your private agenda, you're allowed to put your talents to work in your unique way.
That said, you must never lose sight of the fact that you are part of a larger community. That includes the whole guild, of course, but your ties to community start with your vernadi (enclave) and its voda (dryad leader). The dryads want to know what you're doing and what purpose it serves, and they act to curtail your actions—or even expel you from the guild—if they determine that you aren't serving Selesnya's best interests.

Usually, this information comes from a Simic laboratory, or sometimes from an Izzet facility, a library, a university, or an independent scholar or other learned person or creature. Knowing where the information can be found doesn't automatically enable you to learn it; you might need to offer bribes, favors, or other incentives to induce people to reveal their secrets.
Your DM might rule that the knowledge you seek is secreted away in an inaccessible place, or that it simply can't be found. Unearthing the deepest secrets of the multiverse can require an adventure or even a whole campaign.

2 | In my laboratory, I discovered something that I think could eliminate half the life on Ravnica.
3 | The other researchers in my clade are my family—a big, eccentric family including members and parts of many species.

        <name>Contacts</name>
      <text>The fluid nature of clades, whose rosters span different laboratories and change as researchers discover new interests, creates abundant connections among the Simic. The guild members live in watery sinkholes called zonots, and their isolation shelters them from much contact with outsiders. Nonetheless, a fair number of Simic members are former members of other guilds.
Roll twice on the Simic Contacts table (for an ally and a rival) and once on the Non-Simic Contacts table.
Simic Contacts
d8 | Contact
1 | My research builds on my parents' work and takes it in interesting new directions.
2 | If a serious problem confounds me, I can count on my mentor to provide clarity of thought.
3 | A former laboratory colleague went on to work on the Guardian Project.
4 | A former colleague has ventured into fields of research that are possibly immoral and almost certainly illegal.
5 | A former lover is now the supervisor of a prominent clade.
6 | My sibling has become an almost unrecognizable mutant.
7 | An old friend has retreated into a secluded life as an ascetic deepsage, devoted to contemplating philosophical principles.
8 | My former clade supervisor is now engaged in field research studying some of the largest beasts and monsters on Ravnica.

Non-Simic Contacts
d10 | Contact
1 | My older sibling is upset that I didn't follow them into the Azorius.
2 | A Boros sergeant is always asking questions about my work, but I suspect they're genuinely curious.
3 | A friend in my clade thinks I don't know they're a Dimir agent.
4 | I helped a Golgari spore druid with the fertilization and growth of their fungus field.
5 | I can't fathom what could have made my childhood friend run off and join the Gruul.
6 | I love comparing notes with my friend in the Izzet, though our fields of research are very different.
7 | I borrowed a lot of money from an Orzhov syndic to help finance my research.
8 | A Rakdos ringmaster has taken an interest in my research which, come to think of it, might make a nice sideshow act.
9 | I left the Selesnya—and a lover—behind when I joined the Simic.
10 | Roll an additional Simic contact; you can decide if the contact is an ally or a rival.

        <name>How Do I Fit In?</name>
      <text>As a Simic adventurer, your mission likely aligns with the Adaptationist philosophy; the disagreements and tensions among the guilds will soon erupt into open conflict, and your guild needs your help to ensure that the Simic survive. That help might come in the form of defending against Golgari incursions into Simic zonots or shielding Simic research from Azorius intrusion. It could also involve more subtle, diplomatic work to maintain balance among the guilds, or subterfuge aimed at undermining another guild's grab for power.
Self-improvement is also an important part of your mission. Anything you can do to make yourself more capable—whether learning a new spell or adopting a new hybridizing mutation—gives the Simic a stronger weapon in its arsenal. The combine must change to survive, and that means individual members of the guild must grow and adapt as well.

      <text>You are acquainted with a network of smugglers who are willing to help you out of tight situations. While in a particular town, city, or other similarly sized community (DM's discretion), you and your companions can stay for free in safe houses. Safe houses provide a poor lifestyle. While staying at a safe house, you can choose to keep your presence (and that of your companions) a secret.

      <text>Every smuggler has that one tale that sets them apart from common criminals. By wits, sailing skill, or a silver tongue, you lived to tell the story—and you tell it often. You can roll on the following table to determine your claim or choose one that best fits your character.
d6 | Accomplishment
1 | Spirit of the Whale. You smuggled stolen dwarven spirits in the body of a dead whale being pulled behind a fishing boat. When you delivered the goods, the corpse suddenly exploded, sending whale meat and whiskey bottles for half a mile.
2 | Cart and Sword. You drove a cart filled with stolen art through the middle of a battlefield while singing sea shanties to confuse the combatants.
3 | The Recruit. You enlisted in another nation's navy for the purpose of smuggling stolen jewels to a distant port. You attained a minor rank before disappearing from the navy and making your way here.
4 | River of Shadows. Your riverboat accidentally slipped through the veil into the Shadowfell for several hours. While you were there, you sold some stolen dragonborn artifacts before returning to this plane and paddling home.
5 | Gold-Hearted. You agreed to transport a family escaping a war. The baby began to cry at a checkpoint, and you gave the guards all your gold to let you pass. The family never found out about this gesture.
6 | Playing Both Sides. You once smuggled crates of crossbow bolts and bundles of arrows, each destined for an opposing side in a regional war, at the same time. The buyers arrived within moments of each other but did not discover your trickery.

Then the dragon called Vorgansharax arrived and laired in the hills, causing horrid thickets to grow and animals to act unusually. The cultists began raiding nomad camps for victims to offer to the wyrm. Eventually, the dragon moved on to attack Phlan, but life was never again the same for the nomads of the Ticklebelly Hills.

    <trait>
        <name>Description</name>
      <text>Before you became an adventurer, your life was already full of conflict and excitement, because you made a living tracking down people for pay. Unlike some people who collect bounties, though, you aren't a savage who follows quarry into or through the wilderness. You're involved in a lucrative trade, in the place where you live, that routinely tests your skills and survival instincts. What's more, you aren't alone, as a bounty hunter in the wild would be: you routinely interact with both the criminal subculture and other bounty hunters, maintaining contacts in both areas to help you succeed.
You might be a cunning thief-catcher, prowling the rooftops to catch one of the myriad burglars of the city. Perhaps you are someone who has your ear to the street, aware of the doings of thieves' guilds and street gangs. You might be a "velvet mask" bounty hunter, one who blends in with high society and noble circles in order to catch the criminals that prey on the rich, whether pickpockets or con artists. The community where you plied your trade might have been one of Faerûn's great metropolises, such as Waterdeep or Baldur's Gate, or a less populous location, perhaps Luskan or Yartar—any place that's large enough to have a steady supply of potential quarries.
As a member of an adventuring party, you might find it more difficult to pursue a personal agenda that doesn't fit with the group's objectives—but on the other hand, you can take down much more formidable targets with the help of your companions.

      <text>You grew up on the streets alone, orphaned, and poor. You had no one to watch over you or to provide for you, so you learned to provide for yourself. You fought fiercely over food and kept a constant watch out for other desperate souls who might steal from you. You slept on rooftops and in alleyways, exposed to the elements, and endured sickness without the advantage of medicine or a place to recuperate. You've survived despite all odds, and did so through cunning, strength, speed, or some combination of each.
You begin your adventuring career with enough money to live modestly but securely for at least ten days. How did you come by that money? What allowed you to break free of your desperate circumstances and embark on a better life?

    <trait>
        <name>Description</name>
      <text>Though you might have only recently arrived in civilized lands, you are no stranger to the values of cooperation and group effort when striving for supremacy. You learned these principles, and much more, as a member of an Uthgardt tribe.
Your people have always tried to hold to the old ways. Tradition and taboo have kept the Uthgardt strong while the kingdoms of others have collapsed into chaos and ruin. But for the last few generations, some bands among the tribes were tempted to settle, make peace, trade, and even to build towns. Perhaps this is why Uthgar chose to raise up the totems among the people as living embodiments of his power. Perhaps they needed a reminder of who they were and from whence they came. The Chosen of Uthgar led bands back to the old ways, and most of your people abandoned the soft ways of civilization.
You might have grown up in one of the tribes that had decided to settle down, and now that they have abandoned that path, you find yourself adrift. Or you might come from a segment of the Uthgardt that adheres to tradition, but you seek to bring glory to your tribe by achieving great things as a formidable adventurer.
See the "Uthgardt Lands" section of chapter 2 for details on each tribe's territory and its activities that will help you choose your affiliation.
• Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Survival
• Languages: Any one of your choice
• Tool Proficiencies: One type of musical instrument or artisan's tools

      <text>Though this section details the Uthgardt specifically, either it or the outlander background from the Player's Handbook can be used for a character whose origin lies with one of the other barbarian tribes in Faerûn.
You might be a fair-haired barbarian of the Reghed, dwelling in the shadow of the Reghed Glacier in the far North near Icewind Dale. You might also be of the nomadic Rashemi, noted for their savage berserkers and their masked witches. Perhaps you hail from one of the wood elf tribes in the Chondalwood, or the magic-hating human tribes of the sweltering jungles of Chult.
</text>
      </trait>

        <name>Feature: Uthgardt Heritage</name>
      <text>You have an excellent knowledge of not only your tribe's territory, but also the terrain and natural resources of the rest of the North. You are familiar enough with any wilderness area that you can find twice as much food and water as you normally would when you forage there.
Additionally, you can call upon the hospitality of your people, and those allied with your tribe, often including members of the druid circles, tribes of nomadic elves, the Harpers, and the priesthoods devoted to the gods of the First Circle.

      <text>Use the tables for the outlander background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a member of an Uthgardt tribe.
Even if you have left your tribe behind (at least for now), you hold to the traditions of your people. You will never cut down a still-living tree, and you may not countenance such an act being done in your presence. The Uthgardt ancestral mounds - great hills where the totem spirits were defeated by Uthgar and where the heroes of the tribes are interred - are sacred to you.
Your bond is undoubtedly associated with your tribe or some aspect of Uthgardt philosophy or culture (perhaps even Uthgar himself). Your ideal is a personal choice that probably hews closely to the ethos of your people and certainly doesn't contradict or compromise what being an Uthgardt stands for.

Your retainers can perform mundane tasks for you, but they do not fight for you, will not follow you into obviously dangerous areas (such as dungeons), and will leave if they are frequently endangered or abused.

        <name>Suggested Characteristics</name>
      <text>Nobles are born and raised to a very different lifestyle than most people ever experience, and their personalities reflect that upbringing. A noble title comes with a plethora of bonds—responsibilities to family, to other nobles (including the sovereign), to the people entrusted to the family's care, or even to the title itself. But this responsibility is often a good way to undermine a noble.

        <name>Tragedy</name>
      <text>Happy people aren't selected to join the Volstrucker. The Cerberus Assembly preys upon talented individuals who have been broken by tragedy—in some cases, tragedy that the Volstrucker has arranged for. A slightly broken mind is more easily reshaped and reeducated. Choose the tragedy that set you on this path, or roll on the Tragedies table.
d6 | Tragedy
1 | Familicide. Through deceit or manipulation, the Volstrucker convinced you to slaughter your own family.
2 | Amnesia. You were forced to study magic so potent that it strained your mind beyond mortal limits, stealing away the memories of your past.
3 | Capture. You were captured and tortured by agents of the Kryn Dynasty, and barely escaped.
4 | Starvation. A terrible blight afflicted your rural village, and many of your friends and family members starved to death. You survived, but only barely.
5 | Disfigurement. One of your arcane experiments went wrong and scarred or dismembered you so gravely that others now shun you. Only the Volstrucker showed you kindness after that day.
6 | Vicissitude. You were once the scion of a wealthy family who lost their entire fortune in the blink of an eye.

The ink used to send a letter across the shadow network is the same as that used by a wizard to scribe spells in a spellbook. Writing a letter in this ink costs 10 gp per page.

    <trait>
        <name>Description</name>
      <text>You are a scion of one of the great noble families of Waterdeep. Human families who jealously guard their privilege and place in the City of Splendors, Waterdhavian nobles have a reputation across Faerûn for being eccentric, spoiled, venal, and, above all else, rich.
Whether you are a shining example of the reason for this reputation or one who proves the rule by being an exception, people expect things of you when they know your surname and what it means. Your reasons for taking up adventuring likely involve your family in some way: Are you the family rebel, who prefers delving in filthy dungeons to sipping zzar at a ball? Or have you taken up sword or spell on your family's behalf, ensuring that they have someone of renown to see to their legacy?
Work with your DM to come up with the family you are part of—there are around seventy-five lineages in Waterdeep, each with its own financial interests, specialties, and schemes. You might be part of the main line of your family, possibly in line to become its leader one day. Or you might be one of any number of cousins, with less prestige but also less responsibility.
• Skill Proficiencies: History, Persuasion
• Languages: Any one of your choice
• Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set or musical instrument
• Equipment: A set of fine clothes, a signet ring or brooch, a scroll of pedigree, a skin of fine zzar or wine, and a purse containing 20 gp

        <name>Feature: Kept in Style</name>
      <text>While you are in Waterdeep or elsewhere in the North, your house sees to your everyday needs. Your name and signet are sufficient to cover most of your expenses; the inns, taverns, and festhalls you frequent are glad to record your debt and send an accounting to your family's estate in Waterdeep to settle what you owe.
This advantage enables you to live a comfortable lifestyle without having to pay 2 gp a day for it, or reduces the cost of a wealthy or aristocratic lifestyle by that amount. You may not maintain a less affluent lifestyle and use the difference as income—the benefit is a line of credit, not an actual monetary reward.

      <text>Use the tables for the noble background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a member of a Waterdhavian family.
Like other nobles, you were born and raised in a different world from the one that most folk know - one that grants you privilege but also calls you to fulfill a duty befitting your station. Your bond might be associated with your family alone, or it could be concerned with another noble house that sides with or opposes your own. Your ideal depends to some extent on how you view your role in the family, and how you intend to conduct yourself in the world at large as a representative of your house.
