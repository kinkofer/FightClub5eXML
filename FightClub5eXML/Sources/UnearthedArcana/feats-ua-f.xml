    <prerequisite></prerequisite>
    <text>You have studied the secrets of alchemy and are an expert in its practice, gaining the following benefits:
• You gain proficiency with Alchemist (UA)'s supplies. If you are already proficient with them, you add double your proficiency bonus to checks you make with them.
• As an action, you can identify one potion within 5 feet of you, as if you had tasted it. You must see the liquid for this benefit to work.
• Over the course of any short rest, you can temporarily improve the potency of one potion of healing of any rarity. To use this benefit, you must have Alchemist (UA)'s supplies with you, and the potion must be within reach. If the potion is drunk no more than 1 hour after the short rest ends, the creature drinking the potion can forgo the potion's die roll and regains the maximum number of hit points that the potion can restore.

  <feat>
      <name>Spear Mastery (UA)</name>
    <prerequisite></prerequisite>
    <text>Though the spear is a simple weapon to learn, it rewards you for the time you have taken to master it. You gain the following benefits:
• You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls you make with a spear.
• When you use a spear, its damage die changes from a d6 to a d8, and from a d8 to a d10 when wielded with two hands. (This benefit has no effect if another feature has already improved the weapon's die.)
• You can set your spear to receive a charge. As a bonus action, choose a creature you can see that is at least 20 feet away from you. If that creature moves within your spear's reach on its next turn, you can make a melee attack against it with your spear as a reaction. If the attack hits, the target takes an extra 1d8 piercing damage, or an extra 1d10 piercing damage if you wield the spear with two hands. You can't use this ability if the creature used the Disengage action before moving.
• As a bonus action on your turn, you can increase your reach with a spear by 5 feet for the rest of your turn.

      <name>Warhammer Master (UA)</name>
    <prerequisite></prerequisite>
    <text>This feat is presented as an illustrative example of a poorly-designed feat, and is not intended to be used in play. The Fell Handed feat is presented as a well-designed implementation of the same ideas, and should be used instead.
When you hit a creature with a warhammer, the  creature must succeed on a Strength saving  throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your  Strength modifier) or be knocked prone.
In addition, you can use your warhammer to  knock away a foe's shield. If you hit a creature  that's using a shield, you can have the attack deal  no damage and force the creature to drop its  shield.
