        <text>Note: The Love domain was included in a leaked pre-release version of Unearthed Arcana 2020 Subclasses, Part 2, and superseded by the Unity domain for the final release.</text>
        <text>Love exists in many forms—compassion, infatuation, friendly affection, and passionate love as a few facets. Whatever form these feelings take, the gods of love deepen the bonds between individuals.</text>

          <name>Love Domain (UA): Emboldening Bond</name>
        <text>1st-level Love Domain feature</text>
        <text>You can forge an empowering bond between allies. As an action, you can choose two willing creatures you can see within 30 feet of you (this can include yourself) and create a magical bond between them. While either bonded creature is within 30 feet of the other, the creature can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw it makes. Each creature can add the d4 no more than once per turn. The bond lasts for 1 hour or until you use this feature again.</text>
        <text>You can use this feature once, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. You can also expend a spell slot to use the feature again.</text>

        <text>You can use your Channel Divinity to overwhelm a creature with a flash of short-lived but intense admiration for you, driving them to rash action in your defense.</text>
        <text>As an action, you present your holy symbol and choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw; a creature can choose to fail this saving throw if it wishes. On a success, the creature is unaffected. On a failure, the creature is charmed by you until the start of your next turn, and it must immediately use its reaction to make a weapon attack against a target you designate. If there are no valid targets, it uses its reaction to admire you.</text>

Distribute the damage taken between the original target and the chosen creatures. Each creature must take at least 1 damage. Apply any damage resistance or vulnerability of the creatures involved after you distribute the damage.</text>
