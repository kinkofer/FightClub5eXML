            <text>Roamers at heart, centaurs love open spaces and the freedom to travel. As much as they can, centaurs run. They race the wind, hooves thundering and tails streaming behind them.
                In the sprawling city of Ravnica, where "open road" seems like a contradiction and "open plain" is sheer nonsense, centaurs nevertheless retain a love of wide spaces and the freedom to travel. As much as they can, centaurs run—in wide plazas, spacious parks, and expanses of rubble and ruin. They race the wind, hooves thundering and tails streaming behind them, until the next wall looms in their path and brings them to a stop.

            <name>Alignment</name>
            <text>Centaurs are inclined toward neutrality. Those who join the Selesnya are more often neutral good, while those who join the Gruul are typically chaotic neutral.

        <trait>
            <name>Charge</name>
            <text>If you move at least 30 feet straight toward a target and then hit it with a melee weapon attack on the same turn, you can immediately follow that attack with a bonus action, making one attack against the target with your hooves.
            </text>
        </trait>
        <trait>
            <name>Hooves</name>
            <text>Your hooves are natural melee weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

            <text>You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push or drag.
                In addition, any climb that requires hands and feet is especially difficult for you because of your equine legs. When you make such a climb, each foot of movement costs you 4 extra feet, instead of the normal 1 extra foot.

        <trait>
            <name>Nature's Cavalry</name>
            <text>Centaurs have humanoid upper bodies, displaying all the human variety of skin tones and features. In size, they are comparable to a human rider mounted on a horse, and they fill similar roles—as cavalry, messengers, outriders, and scouts.
                Centaurs' ears are slightly pointed, but their faces are more wide and square than those of elves. Below the waist, they have the bodies of horses, with coats tending toward brown shades (chestnut or bay) and darker tails.
            </text>
        </trait>
        <trait>
            <name>Nature and Community</name>
            <text>Centaurs have a strong sense of the interconnectedness of the natural world, and they celebrate family and community as microcosms of that greater connection. The birth of a foal is always cause for festivities. At the same time, centaurs revere the traditions of the past, preserving old ways and keeping alive the legends of ancestral heroes. They feel a close kinship with wild animals, perhaps because of their own hybrid nature, and delight in the feeling of running alongside herds and packs of beasts.
            </text>
        </trait>
        <trait>
            <name>Centaur Names</name>
            <text>Centaurs' given names are passed down through family lines. The name given to a new foal is typically the name of the most recently deceased family member of the same gender, keeping alive the memory—and, the centaurs believe, some shard of the spirit—of the departed.
                Centaurs rarely use family names, but wear symbols that represent their family membership. These symbols might include graphical representations of plants or animals, printed mottos, braids and beads worn in the hair and tail, or even specific patterns of woven fabric.

        </trait>
        <trait>
            <name>Nature's Cavalry</name>
            <text>Centaurs have the upper bodies, down to the waist, of muscular humans, displaying all the human variety of skin tones and features. Their ears are slightly pointed, but their faces are wider and squarer than those of elves. Below the waist, they have the bodies of small horses, with a similar range of coloration—from various shades of chestnut or bay to dappled or even zebra-like striped patterns. Most centaurs style their hair and their tails in a similar way. Selesnya centaurs favor long, flowing hair. Gruul centaurs cut their hair in rough, spiky styles.
                The upper bodies of centaurs are comparable to human torsos in size, and their lower equine bodies average about 4 feet tall at the withers. Though they are smaller than a human rider mounted on a horse, they fill similar roles as cavalry warriors, messengers, outriders, and scouts.

        </trait>
        <trait>
            <name>Affinity for Nature</name>
            <text>Centaurs have an affinity for the natural world. Among the guilds that share that affinity, centaurs favor the rubblebelts of the Gruul Clans and the wide plazas of the Selesnya Conclave over the undercity tunnels of the Golgari and the laboratories of the Simic.
                Centaurs celebrate life and growth, and the birth of a foal is always cause for festivities. At the same time, they revere the traditions of the past, and among both the Gruul and the Selesnya they are voices of memory and history, preserving old ways and keeping alive the legends of ancestral heroes. They feel a close kinship with wild animals, perhaps because of their own horse-like bodies, and delight in the feeling of running alongside herds and packs of other beasts.
            </text>
        </trait>
        <trait>
            <name>Clans and Community</name>
            <text>Centaurs sense the interconnectedness of the natural world. Thus, they celebrate family and community as microcosms of that greater connection. Among the Gruul, they have a strong clan identity, and Selesnya centaurs are fiercely loyal to their individual communities as well as the guild as a whole. Their love of history and tradition also means that centaurs are more likely than most other Ravnicans to join the same guild that their parents did.

            <text>Whether sniveling in fear, cackling with mad laughter, or snarling in a fury, goblins are wretched and inconsequential—at least in the eyes of most of Ravnica's other folk. In their own minds, though, they are content to lurk in the shadows only until they fully come into their own and receive the recognition they believe they deserve. They are entitled to some credit for their tenacity, agility, crafty ingenuity, and dumb luck, all of which has enabled them to survive in a world overrun with creatures larger and more powerful than they are.

            <text>When you damage a creature with an attack or a spell and the creature's size is larger than yours, you can cause the attack or spell to deal extra damage to the creature.

            <name>Small and Wiry</name>
            <text>Standing around 3 feet tall and covered in warty green or red skin, goblins have huge noses and ears. Their wiry bodies are surprisingly strong, and their mouths are full of sharp, crooked teeth.
                Most goblins are bald, either by heredity or by choice, but a few boast shocks of red or black hair. Their arms and legs are elongated in proportion to their small bodies, and their fingers and toes are also long and slender. Many goblins prefer to go unshod to leave their toes exposed for climbing.

        <trait>
            <name>Unfettered Emotion</name>
            <text>Creatures of raw impulse, goblins are found among guilds that value that quality, particularly the Izzet (where they typically serve as attendants for researchers), the Gruul (in camps that form hapless buffers between the clans and civilized regions), the Rakdos (putting their love of explosions to good use), and occasionally the Boros (if they discover a well of discipline and courage within themselves, or find themselves unable to resist the shininess of Boros weapons and armor). Many goblins are guildless and make their way as members of street gangs.
                Sometimes driven by wild mood swings, goblins have an inclination toward destruction, which can take a playful form but is often anything but. Some goblins clobber things, others like to light them on fire, and many love to blow things up.
                Goblins have an outrageous sense of humor, usually expressed through mischievous pranks. The malicious among them find pleasure in the misfortune of others and tend to cackle maniacally whenever they're amused. They can act with apparent randomness, sometimes just to confuse and befuddle others.

      <autolevel level="1">
          <feature optional="YES">
              <name>Divine Domain: Order Domain</name>
              <text>The Order Domain represents discipline, as well as devotion to a society or an institution and strict obedience to the laws governing it. On Ravnica, the domain is favored by clerics of the Azorius Senate, who use it to maintain and enforce the law, and of the Orzhov Syndicate, who exploit law and order for their personal gain. On other worlds, gods who grant access to this domain include Bane, Tyr, Majere, Erathis, Pholtus, Wee Jas, Aureon, Maglubiyet, Nuada, Athena, Anubis, Forseti, and Asmodeus.</text>
              <text>The ideal of order is obedience to the law above all else, rather than to a specific individual or the passing influence of emotion or popular rule. Clerics of order are typically concerned with how things are done, rather than whether an action's results are just. Following the law and obeying its edicts is critical, especially when it benefits these clerics and their guilds or deities.</text>
              <text>Law establishes hierarchies. Those selected by the law to lead must be obeyed. Those who obey must do so to the best of their ability. In this manner, law creates an intricate web of obligations that allows society to forge order and security in a chaotic multiverse.</text>

                <text>Druids of this circle have a complex relationship with the undead. Unlike most other druids, they see nothing inherently wrong with undeath, which they consider to be a companion to life and death. But these druids believe that the natural cycle is healthiest when each segment of it is vibrant and changing. Undead that seek to replace all life with undeath, or that try to avoid passing to a final rest, violate the cycle and must be thwarted.</text>

                <text>Circle Spells</text>
                <text>   Your symbiotic link to fungus and your ability to tap into the cycle of life and death grants you access to certain spells. At 2nd level, you learn the chill touch cantrip. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the Circle of Spores Spells table.</text>
                <text>   Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.</text>

                <text>Halo of Spores</text>
                <text>   Starting at 2nd level, you are surrounded by invisible, necrotic spores that are harmless until you unleash them on a creature nearby. When a creature you can see moves into a space within 10 feet of you or starts its turn there, you can use your reaction to deal 1d4 necrotic damage to that creature unless it succeeds on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. The necrotic damage increases to 1d6 at 6th level, 1d8 at 10th level, and 1d10 at 14th level.</text>
                <text></text>
                <text>Symbiotic Entity</text>
                <text>   At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel magic into your spores. As an action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to awaken those spores, rather than transforming into a beast form, and you gain 4 temporary hit points for each level you have in this class. While this feature is active, you gain the following benefits:</text>
                <text>• When you deal your Halo of Spores damage, roll the damage die a second time and add it to the total.</text>
                <text>• Your melee weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 poison damage to any target they hit.</text>
                <text>   These benefits last for 10 minutes, until you lose all these temporary hit points, or until you use your Wild Shape again.</text>
                <text></text>
                <text>Rule Tip: Temporary Hit Points Don't Stack</text>
                <text>   If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you don't add them together, unless a rule says you can. Instead, you decide which temporary hit points to keep. For more information on temporary hit points, see chapter 9 of the Player's Handbook.</text>

                <name>Fungal Infestation (Circle of Spores)</name>
                <text>   At 6th level, your spores gain the ability to infest a corpse and animate it. If a beast or a humanoid that is Small or Medium dies within 10 feet of you, you can use your reaction to animate it, causing it to stand up immediately with 1 hit point. The creature uses the zombie stat block in the Monster Manual. It remains animate for 1 hour, after which time it collapses and dies.</text>
                <text>   In combat, the zombie's turn comes immediately after yours. It obeys your mental commands, and the only action it can take is the Attack action, making one melee attack.</text>
                <text>   You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.</text>

                <text>   At 10th level, you gain the ability to seed an area with deadly spores. As a bonus action while your Symbiotic Entity feature is active, you can hurl spores up to 30 feet away, where they swirl in a 10-foot cube for 1 minute. The spores disappear early if you use this feature again, if you dismiss them as a bonus action, or if your Symbiotic Entity feature is no longer active.</text>
                <text>   Whenever a creature moves into the cube or starts its turn there, that creature takes your Halo of Spores damage, unless the creature succeeds on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. A creature can take this damage no more than once per turn.</text>
                <text>   While the cube of spores persists, you can't use your Halo of Spores reaction.</text>

        <text>Putting a finger to your head, you pull a memory, an idea, or a message from your mind and transform it into a tangible string of glowing energy called a thought strand, which persists for the duration or until you cast this spell again. The thought strand appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you as a Tiny, weightless, semisolid object that can be held and carried like a ribbon. It is otherwise stationary.
            If you cast this spell while concentrating on a spell or an ability that allows you to read or manipulate the thoughts of others (such as detect thoughts or modify memory), you can transform the thoughts or memories you read, rather than your own, into a thought strand.
            Casting this spell while holding a thought strand allows you to instantly receive whatever memory, idea, or message the thought strand contains. (Casting detect thoughts on the strand has the same effect.)

                Like that of an elephant, a loxodon's trunk is a useful appendage that supplements the hands. In addition to providing a keen sense of smell, the trunk can be used to lift and carry even heavy objects, and the two finger-like protrusions at the tip are capable of delicate manipulation. The trunk can be used to carry both food and liquid to the mouth and can even act as a snorkel.

            <name>Relentlessly Loyal</name>
            <text>Loxodons believe in the value of community and life, and thus are most often found in the Selesnya Conclave. Some who stress the benefits of order have been known to join the Orzhov Syndicate or the Azorius Senate.
                Loxodons believe that the members of a group have a responsibility to look out for each other. Once they have joined a guild or bonded with other individuals in any capacity, they devote themselves to maintaining that bond. They coordinate their efforts and are often willing to sacrifice themselves for the sake of the group. They expect the same loyalty and commitment from the other members of their communities and can be severe in their disappointment when their trust is betrayed.
                The primary difference among loxodons who join different guilds is their sense of the size of the communities they belong to. For loxodons in the Selesnya Conclave, the community is the world and all living beings in it, all valuable, all meant to live in harmony, and all interdependent. For Azorius loxodons, community primarily means the society of sentient races, who need law and order in order to function together. For those in the Orzhov Syndicate, community means the syndicate, with its interests taking priority over those of any other group.

            <text>Immediately after you hit a creature with a melee attack as part of the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action to attempt to shove that target with your horns. The target must be no more than one size larger than you and within 5 feet of you. Unless it succeeds on a Strength saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier, you push it up to 10 feet away from you.

            <name>Horns and Hooves</name>
            <text>Minotaurs are barrel-chested humanoids with heads resembling those of bulls. Their horns range in size from about 1 foot long to great, curling weapons easily three times that length. They often ornament their horns with metal rings or sheathe them in metal to protect them from damage.
                Manes of shaggy fur extend down minotaurs' necks and powerful backs, and males have long tufts of hair on their chins and cheeks. Their legs end in heavy, cloven hooves. Minotaurs are born with long, tufted tails, but minotaurs of the Ordruun clan (and some others) have their tails docked as part of a coming-of-age ceremony; they find the heavy armor of the Boros legion much more comfortable without a long tail in the way.

            <text>Minotaurs are zealous and love battle. They are found among the Gruul Clans, but the minotaurs of the Ordruun family line, long associated with the Boros Legion, are much better known and respected. Boros minotaurs choose the precision of the legion over the fury of the pack.
                Minotaurs tend to vent their outrage through violence, but they aren't generally quick to anger. They are passionate, loving their friends and partners fiercely, and they laugh loud and long at good jokes.

            <name>Family and Guild</name>
            <text>Minotaur legends describe a small pantheon of heroes—perhaps they were once thought of as gods—who established the minotaurs' place in the world. Every minotaur in Ravnica claims descent from one of these heroes. The Ordruun line is the most prominent, with thousands of members descended from an ancient hero who is said to have taught minotaurs the arts of war. Other important family lines include the Kharran line (primarily associated with the Gruul Scab clan), the Drendaa line (found scattered among the Gruul Clans), and the Tazgral line (divided between the Boros and the Gruul, with a significant number in the Rakdos as well).
                Since each family line has so many members, minotaurs don't usually find it helpful to connect the name of the line to their personal names; even though Commander Grozdan of the Boros Legion's Kamen Fortress is a prominent member of the Ordruun line, he would never call himself Grozdan Ordruun the way a human would.

Almost every minotaur name is drawn from that long list of minor characters of legend, so that those folk are never forgotten.

            <name>Animal Enhancement</name>
            <text>Your body has been altered to incorporate certain animal characteristics. You choose one animal enhancement now and a second enhancement at 5th level.
                At 1st level, choose one of the following options:
                • Manta Glide: You have ray-like fins that you can use as wings to slow your fall or allow you to glide. When you fall and aren't incapacitated, you can subtract up to 100 feet from the fall when calculating falling damage, and you can move up to 2 feet horizontally for every 1 foot you descend.
                • Nimble Climber: You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.
                • Underwater Adaptation: You can breathe air and water, and you have a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.
                At 5th level, your body evolves further, developing new characteristics. Choose one of the options you didn't take at 1st level, or one of the following options:
                • Grappling Appendage: You have two special appendages growing alongside your arms. Choose whether they're both claws or tentacles. As an action, you can use one of them to try to grapple a creature. Each one is also a natural weapon, which you can use to make an unarmed strike. If you hit with it, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. Immediately after hitting, you can try to grapple the target as a bonus action. These appendages can't precisely manipulate anything and can't wield weapons, magic items, or other specialized equipment.
                • Carapace: Your skin in places is covered by a thick shell. You gain a +1 bonus to AC when you're not wearing heavy armor.
                • Acid Spit: As an action, you can spray acid from glands in your mouth, targeting one creature or object you can see within 30 feet of you. The target takes 2d10 acid damage unless it succeeds on a Dexterity saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. This damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 11th level (3d10) and 17th level (4d10). You can use this trait a number of times equal to your Consitution modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

            <name>Extensive Adaptation</name>
            <text>Simic hybrids share many of the characteristics of their original race, including their basic physical form. Human hybrids are the most versatile, filling a variety of roles. Agile elf hybrids retain the ability to see in darkness, making them ideal as spies, scouts, and infiltrators. And vedalken hybrids possess the same calculating intellect as other vedalken, making them superior tacticians, strategists, and spellcasters.
                Hybrids' biological enhancements can change their appearance drastically. All hybrids possess some physical characteristics of animals, mostly aquatic and reptilian creatures. These include crab claws, squid tentacles, wings that look like mays or fins, translucent or camouflaged skin, or sharklike maws filled with sharp teeth.
                Hybrids are the product of Simic magic. It's not impossible for a hybrid to leave the Simic Combine and join another guild, but the Simic would consider the hybrid a deserter and the new guild might never fully welcome a hybrid who could easily be a Simic spy.

            <text>As a member of the Azorius Senate, you are probably engaged in the work of law enforcement (even if your background involved the legislative or judicial aspects of the senate's activities). Legislative aides and judges' clerks find little reason to venture beyond the Azorius guildhalls, but soldiers and lawmages patrol the streets daily.
                An Azorius soldier or lawmage is a force for order, charged with fighting crime on the streets—and in the halls of power. You might spend your time foiling thefts, putting a stop to Orzhov extortion, rooting out Dimir spies, or hunting down Golgari assassins. Perhaps you take your orders from a precognitive mage (or you are one yourself) who receives unpredictable and cryptic visions of future crimes that you and your allies must try to prevent.

            <text>As a Dimir adventurer, you are a member of the guild's network of spies, thieves, assassins, and mind mages that lurks behind the facade of the public guild. On the surface, House Dimir presents the appearance of a network of couriers, investigators, media reporters, and archivists, dealing in information and spreading news. But you and your peers trade in secrets. You use secret symbols, runes, and signals to surreptitiously communicate with other Dimir agents, often in plain sight.
                Like any good spy, you have multiple identities: your true face as an agent of House Dimir; a guildless identity; and a role as a member of another guild. Within that secondary guild, you might already be on a mission for House Dimir, assigned to spy on the guild, collect information about a person, or recruit another spy from the ranks of the guild. Or that guild could be a launching point for your real mission. Perhaps, for example, you were ordered to infiltrate the Azorius in hopes of gaining access to a notorious inmate in an Azorius prison.

            <name>How Do I Fit In?</name>
            <text>As part of the Golgari Swarm, you are a specialized instrument of the greater body. Your orders, when you have such, come from the guildmaster by way of his chancellors, who carry his messages throughout the guild. The swarm relies on you to advance the greater good by protecting some part, however small, of its teeming existence. That responsibility doesn't mean you're indispensable; your eventual death is part of your purpose and function, too, and you'll be replaced even as your body provides nutrients to further the swarm's growth.
                A classic adventuring role for a member of the Golgari involves crawling through dungeon-like environments—the sewers and ancient vaults of the undercity—in search of treasures left behind by the dead. Sometimes you might be sent to find a specific item believed lost in a dangerous part of the undercity. At other times, you could be asked to collect samples of a specific fungus, retrieve a body floating in the muck of the sewers, or bring back whatever booty you can to help fill the swarm's coffers.
                You might gain enough renown to become a member of the Ochran, assigned to a variety of tasks concerning thievery, assassination, or the protection of important figures in your guild. You might steal something because the guild needs it, or because its loss will bring harm to another guild, hastening that group's decline. You could be assigned to kill an outspoken and active enemy of the Golgari, such as an overzealous Boros captain whose raids into the undercity have approached dangerously close to the swarm's inner sanctum. Or you could serve as a bodyguard to one of Guildmaster Jarad's high chancellors, escorting this figure through the undercity while being ready to intervene at a moment's notice if things go wrong.
                The shamans of the Golgari use their magic to accelerate the cycle of decay and regrowth. You might be sent to spread spores throughout an area that the Golgari want to claim as their territory or to convince the inhabitants of such a territory to abandon it. You might also contend with the ever-present threat of hostile monsters encroaching into Golgari-controlled regions.

With prophecies of the return of Ilharg the Raze-Boar spreading like wildfire among the Gruul druids, you might be asked to carry out some task that the druids believe will speed his coming. Such a task might involve collecting a sacred relic held in an Orzhov vault or collecting sacrifices for a grand ceremony in the Raze-Boar's honor.

            <text>Armed with an inventive intellect, a love of magical technology, and an unquenchable energy, you are an enthusiastic participant in the research work of the Izzet League. Though you're likely to begin your career as a mere attendant, you can aspire to become a skilled mage or alchemist, a laboratory supervisor, or even a flamethrower-wielding scorchbringer tasked with defending Izzet laboratories. The Izzet are obsessive, brilliant, inspired, and an unpredictable force of chaos in Ravnica, and you epitomize all of those qualities.

            <name>Feature: Urban Infrastructure</name>
            <text>The popular conception of the Izzet League is based on mad inventions, dangerous experiments, and explosive blasts. Much of that perception is accurate, but the league is also involved with mundane tasks of construction and architecture—primarily in crafting the infrastructure that allows Ravnicans to enjoy running water, levitating platforms, and other magical and technological wonders.
                You have a basic knowledge of the structure of buildings, including the stuff behind the walls. You can also find blueprints of a specific building in order to learn the details of its construction. Such blueprints might provide knowledge of entry points, structural weaknesses, or secret spaces. Your access to such information isn't unlimited. If obtaining or using the information gets you in trouble with the law, the guild can't shield you from the repercussions.

                For you, the spells on the Izzet Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)

                Cantrip | produce flame, shocking grasp
                1st | chaos bolt, create or destroy water, unseen servant
                2nd | heat metal, rope trick
                3rd | call lightning, elemental weapon, glyph of warding
                4th | conjure minor elementals, divination, Otiluke's resilient sphere
                5th | animate objects, conjure elemental
                
                Your spells tend to be loud, flashy, or explosive, even when the effect is unremarkable. For example, when you open the portal of a rope trick spell, the portal might be outlined by harmless, showy sparkles.
                If you use an arcane focus, it probably takes the form of an intricate device that could include metal gauntlets, glass canisters, copper tubing, and leather straps attaching it to your body. The mizzium apparatus described in chapter 5 is a magical version of this gear.
                The chaos bolt spell is a favorite of Izzet spellcasters because of its unpredictable nature.

                1 | I have a hard time staying focused on... oh, and my brain tends to jump from one... did I mention focus?
                2 | I get really excited about my ideas and I can't wait to talk about them and start putting them into practice and tinkering with them and I want to tell you about how exciting it all is!
                3 | It's not magic—or anything, really—if you do it only halfway. Whatever I do, I give it all I've got.
                4 | I do what my gut tells me.
                5 | Life's an experiment, and I can't wait to see what happens.
                6 | I pepper my speech with the incomprehensible jargon of my trade, like mizzium droplets inserted into a weird-field suspension.
                7 | Great ideas are fine, but great results are what counts.

                3 | Nothing is ever simple, and if it seems simple, I'll find a way to make it complicated.
                4 | I tend to ignore sleep for days when I'm conducting research, often at the expense of my own health and safety.
                5 | I'm convinced there's not a soul in Ravnica, except maybe the great Niv-Mizzet, who can match my boundless intellect.

                3 | One of my former assistants turned out to be a Dimir spy. We're not on friendly terms anymore, but we have a habit of running into each other.

            <text>The Cult of Rakdos encourages independent action on the part of its members. Its goal is fomenting chaos, and it firmly believes in putting its own house in disorder before carrying that mission into the larger city. So your role is to execute your vision of grand satire and disruptive performance art, as you aspire to outdo your guild mates and attract the attention of Rakdos himself.
                You work as part of a troupe, with your artistic talents used in service to a ringmaster's vision. But your performance is your own, and no one expects you to follow a script. In fact, if you go through a performance without doing something you haven't done before, you're clearly not trying hard enough.

A sensation of gentle warmth and the smell of spring flowers or autumn leaves might accompany your spells.

            <text>Although the guild teaches the importance of subjugating the individual will to the good of the conclave, it also celebrates the diversity of individuals, in the same sense that a field that produces different crops is healthier than one that yields a single crop. That principle applies to your skills as an adventurer. As long as your efforts are directed toward advancing the goals of the guild rather than your private agenda, you're allowed to put your talents to work in your unique way.
                That said, you must never lose sight of the fact that you are part of a larger community. That includes the whole guild, of course, but your ties to community start with your vernadi (enclave) and its voda (dryad leader). The dryads want to know what you're doing and what purpose it serves, and they act to curtail your actions—or even expel you from the guild—if they determine that you aren't serving Selesnya's best interests.

                3 | Every social situation I'm in seems to lead to my asking rude personal questions.
                4 | I'm supremely confident in my ability to adapt to any situation and handle any danger.

            <name>Contacts</name>
            <text>The fluid nature of clades, whose rosters span different laboratories and change as researchers discover new interests, creates abundant connections among the Simic. The guild members live in watery sinkholes called zonots, and their isolation shelters them from much contact with outsiders. Nonetheless, a fair number of Simic members are former members of other guilds.
                Roll twice on the Simic Contacts table (for an ally and a rival) and once on the Non-Simic Contacts table.
                d8 | Contact
                1 | My research builds on my parents' work and takes it in interesting new directions.
                2 | If a serious problem confounds me, I can count on my mentor to provide clarity of thought.
                3 | A former laboratory colleague went on to work on the Guardian Project.
                4 | A former colleague has ventured into fields of research that are possibly immoral and almost certainly illegal.
                5 | A former lover is now the supervisor of a prominent clade.
                6 | My sibling has become an almost unrecognizable mutant.
                7 | An old friend has retreated into a secluded life as an ascetic deepsage, devoted to contemplating philosophical principles.
                8 | My former clade supervisor is now engaged in field research studying some of the largest beasts and monsters on Ravnica.
                
                d10 | Contact
                1 | My older sibling is upset that I didn't follow them into the Azorius.
                2 | A Boros sergeant is always asking questions about my work, but I suspect they're genuinely curious.
                3 | A friend in my clade thinks I don't know they're a Dimir agent.
                4 | I helped a Golgari spore druid with the fertilization and growth of their fungus field.
                5 | I can't fathom what could have made my childhood friend run off and join the Gruul.
                6 | I love comparing notes with my friend in the Izzet, though our fields of research are very different.
                7 | I borrowed a lot of money from an Orzhov syndic to help finance my research.
                8 | A Rakdos ringmaster has taken an interest in my research which, come to think of it, might make a nice sideshow act.
                9 | I left the Selesnya—and a lover—behind when I joined the Simic.
                10 | Roll an additional Simic contact; you can decide if the contact is an ally or a rival.

            <name>How Do I Fit In?</name>
            <text>As a Simic adventurer, your mission likely aligns with the Adaptationist philosophy; the disagreements and tensions among the guilds will soon erupt into open conflict, and your guild needs your help to ensure that the Simic survive. That help might come in the form of defending against Golgari incursions into Simic zonots or shielding Simic research from Azorius intrusion. It could also involve more subtle, diplomatic work to maintain balance among the guilds, or subterfuge aimed at undermining another guild's grab for power.
                Self-improvement is also an important part of your mission. Anything you can do to make yourself more capable—whether learning a new spell or adopting a new hybridizing mutation—gives the Simic a stronger weapon in its arsenal. The combine must change to survive, and that means individual members of the guild must grow and adapt as well.

        <description>Horrors and Madness:
            Horrors on Ravnica are terror and madness personified. You can represent this reality by using the madness rules in the Dungeon Master's Guide.
            Whenever a character fails a saving throw against the flying horror's Frightening Screech, the shadow horror's claw attack, or the skittering horror's Maddening Presence, note that fact. At the end of the encounter, have each character who failed at least one of those saving throws make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, nothing happens. On a failed save, a character gains a form of madness from the Dungeon Master's Guide, with the severity depending on how many of the saving throws that character failed during the encounter, as shown on the Madness Severity table.
            Failed Saves | Madness
            1 | Short-term
            2-3 | Long-term
            4+ | Indefinite
            
            Horrors:
            Terrifying evils stalk, fly, and scuttle in the dark corners of Ravnica, from the depths of the undercity to the blackest parts of the night sky. Collectively, these creatures are called horrors-a variety of things that lurk in the dark and embody the deepest fears of Ravnica's people. All are evil creatures with dim reason and preternatural cunning.
            At least three guilds have been known to compel horrors into service. For House Dimir, horrors spread fear and despair in the citizenry and carry out assassinations or kidnappings against well-protected targets. For the Cult of Rakdos, horrors are simply one more weapon in an arsenal of terrifying and shock-inspiring creatures that might appear on stage. For the Golgari Swarm, horrors scavenge the sewers and protect the guild's territory.
            House Dimir uses all three base kinds of horrors. The Cult of Rakdos prefers shadow horrors, and the Golgari Swarm uses skittering horrors.
            Customizing a Horror:
            Horrors share some common body types but vary wildly in other characteristics. A particular horror's form might incorporate elements that resemble fiendish, insectile, or reptilian features. To customize a horror, choose a base creature (flying horror, shadow horror, or skittering horror), then roll once on the Primary Features table and once on the Secondary Features table (or choose an option from each table). Add those features to the base creature.
            
            d4 | Feature
            1 | Avoidance. If the horror is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.
            2 | Damage Resistances. The horror has resistance to necrotic and psychic damage.
            3 | Innate Spellcasting. The horror's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13 for flying horror, DC 16 for shadow horror, and DC 17 for skittering horror). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components: 3/day: darkness 1/day each: fear (shadow horror and skittering horror only), phantasmal killer (skittering horror only)
            4 | Psychic Rebuke. When the horror takes damage from a melee attack, it can use its reaction to emit psychic energy within a 5-foot radius. Each creature in that area takes 3 (1d6) psychic damage (flying horror), 7 (2d6) psychic damage (shadow horror), or 10 (3d6) psychic damage (skittering horror).
            
            d4 | Feature
            1 | Grasping Tendrils. The horror has four tendrils. Each tendril can be attacked (AC 12, 10 hit points). Destroying one deals no damage to the horror. As a bonus action, the horror can target one creature it can see within 10 feet of it. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be grappled by the horror. The DC of the saving throw and the DC to escape the grapple are the same: 9 for the flying horror, 13 for the shadow horror, and 19 for the skittering horror. Until the grapple ends, the horror can't use the same tendril to grapple another target.
            2 | Indomitable Mind. The horror is immune to the charmed condition.
            3 | Keen Senses. The horror has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight, sound, or smell.
            4 | Mind Sight. Magical darkness doesn't impede the horror's darkvision.

A particular horror's form might incorporate elements that resemble fiendish, insectile, or reptilian features. To customize a horror, choose a base creature (flying horror, shadow horror, or skittering horror), then roll once on the Primary Features table and once on the Secondary Features table (or choose an option from each table). Add those features to the base creature.
            d4 | Feature
            1 | Avoidance. If the horror is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.
            2 | Damage Resistances. The horror has resistance to necrotic and psychic damage.
            3 | Innate Spellcasting. The horror's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13 for flying horror, DC 16 for shadow horror, and DC 17 for skittering horror). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components: 3/day: darkness 1/day each: fear (shadow horror and skittering horror only), phantasmal killer (skittering horror only)
            4 | Psychic Rebuke. When the horror takes damage from a melee attack, it can use its reaction to emit psychic energy within a 5-foot radius. Each creature in that area takes 3 (1d6) psychic damage (flying horror), 7 (2d6) psychic damage (shadow horror), or 10 (3d6) psychic damage (skittering horror).
            
            d4 | Feature
            1 | Grasping Tendrils. The horror has four tendrils. Each tendril can be attacked (AC 12, 10 hit points). Destroying one deals no damage to the horror. As a bonus action, the horror can target one creature it can see within 10 feet of it. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be grappled by the horror. The DC of the saving throw and the DC to escape the grapple are the same: 9 for the flying horror, 13 for the shadow horror, and 19 for the skittering horror. Until the grapple ends, the horror can't use the same tendril to grapple another target.
            2 | Indomitable Mind. The horror is immune to the charmed condition.
            3 | Keen Senses. The horror has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight, sound, or smell.
            4 | Mind Sight. Magical darkness doesn't impede the horror's darkvision.

            An archon doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.

        <description>Battleforce angels are the radiant hosts that soar into combat, bathed in the light of Boros zeal. They lead companies of mortal soldiers from above or fly ahead of roc-mounted skyknights. They don't shy away from the blood, pain, and confusion of combat; rather, they immerse themselves in the shifting tides of battle. Only by wading into the battle can they fulfill their responsibility to carry out the commands of the warleaders by adapting their tactics to the shifting situation on the ground.
            Warleaders
            The wisest, most visionary angels are responsible for forming and implementing the military strategy of the Boros Legion. Since they are immortal, their plans might span centuries, and they have been known to accept decades of losses as a reasonable cost for a more significant victory many years later. These warleaders have the statistics of planetars or solars (as presented in the Monster Manual), but their appearance is similar to other Boros angels.

        <description>Gift Givers
            Posing as a beneficent god, a deathpact angel attracts petitioners who beg the angel for blessings: wealth, prestige, health, revenge, and the like. Imagining itself generous and merciful, the angel usually tries to grant the petitioners what they seek by using its abilities, drawing from its hoard of riches, or extorting favors from other members of the guild. True to the spirit of the Orzhov, though, the angel doesn't bestow these gifts out of kindness, but for the sake of gaining fanatical followers who owe it life debts.
            Debt and Indenture
            Those who receive favors from a deathpact angel incur a debt that they carry with fervent devotion. They regularly bring trinkets and offerings to the angel, no longer asking or expecting anything in return, and even willingly offer up their mortal lives for their angelic patron. Even after death, these debtors continue to serve the angel and the Orzhov Syndicate as indentured spirits (described later in this chapter).
            Debts Paid
            Orzhov Angels:
            Few angels find anything appealing in the corruption and decadence embodied by the Orzhov Syndicate, since such a society is fundamentally antithetical to their natures, but disillusionment can seduce even immortal beings. When cynicism takes root in an angel's heart, when questions undermine devotion to the cause of justice, when strength becomes a tool to lord over the weak, the Orzhov Syndicate is there to welcome the angel with open arms, offering status, respect, and power.
            Orzhov angels might claim positions as executioners, commanders, or power brokers, but more often they carve out their own place in the guild, standing apart from the otherwise rigid hierarchy of the Orzhov.

        <description>A felidar is a celestial creature whose nature reflects an inherent devotion to law and order. It resembles an enormous cat with two pairs of downward-sloping horns and prominent teeth. Its blue-gray hide has a silvery, geometric pattern, and its thick white mane falls in an orderly fashion around its shoulders.
            Nearly every felidar forms a close bond with one other creature. Winged felidars almost always bond with archons, joining in their relentless pursuit of justice. Other felidars ally with members of the Azorius Senate and form bonds with high-ranking justiciars and ministers, aiding them in enforcing the law and tracking down criminals. Some Azorius felidars form bonds with important prisoners in Azorius custody, ensuring that the felidars can track down the felons if they escape custody.

        <description>Firemane angels are holy champions and paragons of war who specialize in single combat. They are powerful warriors who seek out the mightiest foes in any conflict, trusting lesser soldiers to handle lesser opponents.
            Like many other Boros angels, firemanes typically have red hair. In the heat of battle, a firemane's hair can ignite, transforming into a mane of flames cascading over its shoulders and down its back.
            Warleaders
            The wisest, most visionary angels are responsible for forming and implementing the military strategy of the Boros Legion. Since they are immortal, their plans might span centuries, and they have been known to accept decades of losses as a reasonable cost for a more significant victory many years later. These warleaders have the statistics of planetars or solars (as presented in the Monster Manual), but their appearance is similar to other Boros angels.

        <description>Possessed of arrogance and vanity that matches his vast intellect and tremendous power, Niv-Mizzet is the ancient dragon who founded and continues to control the Izzet League. From his private laboratory at the top of the Izzet guildhall, Niv-Mizzet directs the research and experiments of his countless underlings. He coordinates a tremendous number of apparently unrelated projects, working toward some mysterious end.
            There can be little doubt that this ancient dragon is one of the most intelligent beings on Ravnica and one of the world's most powerful spellcasters. He is just as acquisitive as any dragon, but his treasure is scientific and magical knowledge. His ambition is a looming threat in the minds of all the other guildmasters, but confronting him directly is almost unthinkable thanks to the combination of his awesome magical power and the sheer physical threat of a fire-breathing, swordtoothed dragon.

It hatches when it is in the area of a spell that deals lightning damage, or if a creature touches the egg and expends spell slots whose combined levels equal 13 or more. When it hatches, the egg releases a new arclight phoenix that appears in the egg's space.</text>

While the weird is Large or bigger, it makes Strength checks and saving throws with advantage. If the weird starts its turn at Gargantuan size, the weird releases energy in an explosion. Each creature within 30 feet of the weird must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

        <description>In an effort to create a weird that could be more easily controlled, Izzet mages tried binding elemental lightning, fire, and smoke into a framework made of the magical alloy mizzium. The experiment was partly successful: the resulting weird, a fluxcharger, doesn't explode like some other weirds do, but it is more intelligent and more headstrong than other weirds.
            A fluxcharger's mizzium frame is suggestive of an angel. A faceplate is meant to give it some personality, but most people find its solemn expression and unblinking stare more unnerving than relatable.

        <description>Galvanice weirds seem to be the epitome of weird technology. Indeed, they serve willingly, with cheerful stupidity, as guardians and laborers in Izzet workshops. They combine a rigid body of elemental ice with a core of lightning that animates them. If a galvanice weird is destroyed, the ice shatters and lightning crackles outward in a dangerous explosion. Still, most Izzet researchers find that their usefulness outweighs this risk.

        <description>The Selesnya guildmaster is an amalgamation of three dryads in body, will, and soul. Each dryad's body extends from a central trunk, so while they possess independent minds, they share a single name-Trostani and a single life force. Usually Trostani communicates the will of the Worldsoul with one voice, but she retains three distinct personalities that embody the three parts of the Selesnyan ideal: order, life, and harmony. In the midst of increasing tensions on Ravnica, the three personalities have recently been at odds over how best to navigate the conclave through such difficult times.
            Trostani spends most of her time in the towering tree of Vitu-Ghazi, the Selesnya guildhall. There she communes with Mat'Selesnya and with the dryads who lead individual Selesnya communities across Ravnica.

        <description>Cacklers are small, jabbering jesters that spice up Rakdos performances with their chaotic antics. Their incessant cackling can inspire uncontrollable laughter by making everything—even the most horrifying spectacles—seem hilarious. Some cacklers excel at vocal mimicry and perform as impressionists; others put their sadistic bent to use by lurking in shadows and terrifying passersby. Rakdos performers enjoy dressing cacklers in a variety of masks, hats, and costumes to lampoon public figures.
            Demonic "Devils"
            The creatures called "devils" in Ravnica are minor demons akin to quasits. While the larger demons embody evil qualities such as blood lust and torment, these lesser demons reflect the whimsical and chaotic side of Rakdos and his cult. Their mischievous antics cause disorder and destruction out of proportion to the demons' small size.
            Diabolic Demons
            Many of the demons of Ravnica are monstrous, winged creatures of human-like form. They are best represented by the statistics of the nalfeshnee, the shadow demon, or the vrock in the Monster Manual. Demons associated with the Cult of Rakdos often have fiery attacks that make them similar to barbed devils or horned devils, except that they are demons. (They are chaotic evil, they speak Abyssal and not Infernal, and they lack Devil's Sight.)

            The mesmerizing presence of a master of cruelties draws every eye to the demon and commands an audience's full attention. With every act of depraved torment the demon performs, onlookers are drawn more and more into the blood lust. Audiences clamor for more violence, and those who get too caught up in the revelry feel compelled to partake in the indiscriminate killing.

        <description>Rakdos, the demon for whom his cult is named, embodies hedonism. He is also the consummate entertainer, whose mere appearance is an act of grisly performance art. A monstrous figure standing thirty feet tall, spreading enormous wings, crowned with fire and swinging a flaming scythe, Rakdos demands the spotlight. His every entrance is a showstopper.
            Sometimes after his grand entrance, Rakdos crouches to witness the performances of those who adore him. To them, his opinion is the only one that matters, but he is a demanding spectator. He has seen thousands of years of circus tricks and has no patience for performers who don't give their all. His flaming scythe has brought more than one tepid show to a sudden and spectacular close. Jaded as he is, Rakdos attends his cult's performances only rarely. He often retreats into his lair below the cult's guildhall for months or years at a time, but his followers know that he might emerge at any time to witness the latest spectacle.

        <description>Rakdos nightclubs, where visitors can indulge any dark desire and revel in sadistic spectacle, are the favored haunts of the demons known as sires of insanity. Lurking in an underground vault beneath a Rakdos operation, a sire of insanity feasts on the violence, torment, and depravity unfolding above. Occasionally, cultists bring would-be recruits to the demon's presence, and—true to its name—the sire of insanity breaks the new cultist's mind.
            A sire of insanity is a bloated demon resembling a bipedal lizard. It stands some thirty feet tall and weighs many thousands of pounds, so it tends to keep hidden away in its subterranean lair, working its evil from the shadows.

        <description>Giants in the Cult of Rakdos act as enforcers, bouncers, and sometimes even pillars, holding the mobile platforms that serve as stages for Rakdos performances. Like other members of the cult, giants thrill to the violence of those shows. Though they can seem entranced by the horror unfolding on the stage, they react quickly and brutally to any interruption of the performance.

            Borborygmos leads the Burning Tree clan, which is the largest and most diverse of the Gruul Clans. He is almost always accompanied by other members of his clan-not because he needs their protection, but because they might need his. His companions include creatures ranging from burly giants to cowering goblins.
            The Gruul follow strength, and Borborygmos holds his position only because he has proved stronger than any challenger.

        <description>Most of the giants in the Boros Legion come from a single clan, the Skorskal, that has long been at odds with the Gruul Clans. These giants are guards and gatekeepers, well represented in the Sunhome Guard, as well as powerful muscle supporting Boros missions.
            Giants of the Skorskal clan are often assigned to protect Boros garrisons and forts throughout Ravnica. They are excellent sentinels, keen-eyed and vigilant, and serve as living walls to protect smaller soldiers fighting alongside them. Skorskal giants look much like enormous humans with huge muscles and comparatively small heads.
            Giants:
            Giants use their tremendous size and strength to advance the cause of no less than four guilds. In the Boros Legion and the Orzhov Syndicate, they are cunning soldiers. The giants of the Cult of Rakdos and the Gruul Clans are no less effective but lack discipline.

        <description>Cyclopes like those described in the Monster Manual are found primarily among the Gruul Clans. They are forces of nature, and even though they have occasionally been recruited into the Boros Legion, they can never truly be tamed.
            Cyclopes serve the Izzet league as workshop guardians, personal protectors, and heavy laborers. They wear mizzium armor plating to minimize injuries from laboratory mishaps, piston gauntlets to increase their strength for lifting and punching, and telescopic helmets to minimize the shortcomings of their monocular vision. They are sometimes called monoclons or Nivix cyclopes, after the name of the Izzet guildhall.

        <description>Gruul sunder shamans are angry giants that channel their rage into brutal attacks that deal overwhelming damage to foes and structures alike.
            These shamans sometimes lead hill giants and stone giants that also live among the Gruul Clans. They are occasionally joined by cyclopes, ettins, fomorians, and ogres. Like the rest of the Gruul, they hate the urban development that encroaches on the wilds where they once lived-not least because they have so much difficulty fitting inside the small structures. They delight in destroying such edifices, and in the heat of their rage, they walk through buildings, trample people underfoot, and generally cause as much chaos as possible. They often armor themselves with pieces of buildings and wield columns or other architectural elements as clubs.

        <description>Simic Hybrids:
            The Guardian Project is a consequence of increasing tension within the Simic Combine as the threat of interguild conflict looms. Believing that the Simic must be prepared to fight for their lives when that conflict comes to a head, biomancers have created soldiers to help defend the guild. These hybrids (also called guardians, after the name of the project) are created from human, vedalken, and elf guild members who volunteer to be transformed.

        <description>Blood witches imagine themselves to be the intermediaries between Rakdos and his cult-the pinnacle of his priesthood, his trusted advisors, and the messengers who communicate his will to the scattered troupes and ringmasters. The Cult of Rakdos recognizes no authority but Rakdos, and the demon lord requires no advisors. Nonetheless, the blood witches are smart, charismatic, and powerful, so their voices do carry some weight.
            Blood witches strive both to protect the cult from external interference and to punish those who bring harm to the guild. They claim grandiose titles, such as Tormentor of the Wojek, as a way of mocking their intended victims.

        <description>The End-Raze
            The druids of the Old Ways believe that civilization will never be eradicated by scattered raids and petty skirmishes. They cling to the idea of a coming apocalypse, the End-Raze, when Ilharg's hoofs will trample every brick and stone of Ravnica's soaring skylines to rubble. The world will return to a state of nature in which the lawless code of muscle and savagery will reign once again.

        <description>The Azorius Senate has spellcasters who are trained to capture lawbreakers and bring them to justice. A lawmage's magic is focused on restraining criminals and on protecting bystanders from becoming casualties when arresters are pursuing malefactors. A significant proportion of the guild's vedalken are lawmages.

        <description>Dimir mind mages are among the most feared spellcasters in Ravnica, thanks in large part to the aura of mystery that shrouds them and their work. Their ability to read and alter memories commands respect from the other members of House Dimir and makes them useful in the full spectrum of the guild's activities. Many mind mages lead cells of their own.

        <description>One of the most effective weapons in the Rakdos cult's arsenal is satire, and a Rakdos lampooner is a virtuoso of that art. Lampooners generally reserve their mockery for people and guilds that have seized an outsized measure of power, those who need to be taken down a peg, rather than piling further humiliation onto those who are already struggling. They use masks, marionettes, or effigies to caricature public figures, or sometimes play pranks on those individuals directly in the streets.

        <description>Rubblebelt stalkers are scouts and skirmishers for the Gruul Clans. They excel at moving over challenging terrain, whether they're picking their way through treacherous ruins or clambering across rooftops. They favor ambush tactics and avoid confrontations with stronger forces, relying on their superior mobility to make their escape.

        <description>Golgari shamans are the spiritual leaders of the Golgari Swarm. They teach the guild's beliefs about the cycles of nature, using their necromantic magic to show how life sprouts from death.
            Golgari shamans paint their faces so they appear to have extra eyes on their cheeks and chins. They sometimes use magical moodmark paint (described in chapter 5) to allow them to communicate by means of these marks. They wear clothing adorned with beetle carapaces, spiderwebs, or shelf fungus.
            Golgari Lairs:
            Members of the Golgari Swarm have an intimate connection to their territory. When at least six Golgari defend their territory together, they can call on the environment to aid them. The group must include Jarad Vod Savo or at least one Golgari shaman, kraul death priest, undercity medusa, or Devkarin lich. When determining the difficulty of such an encounter, consider the lair to be one additional creature of challenge rating 1.

        <description>The death priests occupy the highest roles in kraul society. They lead the buzzing chants of the kraul rites. Their inscrutable clicks and buzzing can summon crippling necromantic magic, and the presence of death seems to fortify them. They draw power from the defeat of their enemies and channel it to their followers, ensuring the continuation of the cycle.
            The current leader of the kraul is a death priest named Mazirek.

            The kraul are an ascendant power group within the Golgari Swarm, long content to linger at the margins of the undercity but now increasingly making their buzzing voices heard in the subterranean Golgari guildhall. These six-legged, insectile beings are hard-headed and literal-minded, with little grasp of metaphor or nuance.

        <description>The regal and reticent Prime Speaker Zegana is the merfolk guildmaster of the Simic Combine. She upholds the traditional ways of the guild and its utopian philosophy, which espouses a vision of an ideal world in which nature and civilization coexist in perfect balance. Some people in the guild-members of the Adaptationist faction in particular-argue that her ways are outdated and the guild requires more practical leadership. In response, Zegana maintains that she serves as prime speaker only at the sufferance of the Speakers' Chamber, and if the other speakers wish to replace her, they are certainly within their rights to do so.

        <description>Krasis:
            In the deep sinkholes that serve as laboratories and guildhalls for the Simic Combine, biomancers employ a combination of magic and scientific method to create novel life forms. They coax new morphologies from existing creatures or combine traits from multiple organisms into one, producing the creatures known as krasis. Some krasis are unique creatures that can't reproduce. A few multiply and become part of the guild's standard menagerie.
            Creating a Krasis:
            To create a krasis, choose the appropriate stat block: category 1 (Medium), category 2 (Large), or category 3 (Huge). Then roll once on the Major Adaptations table and once on the Minor Adaptations table (or choose an option from each table) to determine its additional characteristics. The potency of some adaptations varies based on the category of the krasis, as indicated in the descriptions of those adaptations.
            Just a few examples of krasis are the battering krasis (a fusion of hammerhead shark and a powerfully built beast), the crocanura (a crocodile-frog), the drakewing krasis (a lizard-drake), the teratosuchus (a crocodile-crab), the shambleshark (a shark-crab), and the sharktocrab (an improved shambleshark that includes octopus elements as well).
            d8 | Major Adaptation
            1 | Acidic Skin. Any creature that touches the krasis or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 2 (1d4) acid damage (category 1), 4 (1d8) acid damage (category 2), or 6 (1d12) acid damage (category 3).
            2 | Armored Hide. The krasis has better natural armor afforded by a shell or thick scales, increasing its Armor Class by 4.
            3 | Bioluminescent Markings. The krasis has glowing patterns on its skin that take the shape of defensive runes, granting it advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
            4 | Flight. The krasis has wings and gains a flying speed equal to its walking speed.
            5 | Grabber. When the krasis hits a creature with its claws, the target is grappled (escape DC 13 for category 1, DC 15 for category 2, and DC 19 for category 3) by a specialized grasping appendage on the krasis. It can have only one creature grappled in this way at a time.
            6 | Hypnotic Display (Recharge 5-6). As an action, the krasis creates mesmerizing colors and shapes around itself. Each creature within 15 feet of it that can see it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC 12 for category 1, DC 14 for category 2, and DC 18 for category 3) or be stunned for 1 minute. The stunned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on a saving throw against this effect becomes immune to the Hypnotic Display of all krasis for 24 hours.
            7 | Venomous Sting. When the krasis hits a creature with its claws, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 12 for category 1, DC 14 for category 2, and DC 18 for category 3) or be poisoned for 1 minute. If the krasis is a category 2 or 3, the creature is paralyzed while poisoned in this way. The poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
            8 | Regeneration. The krasis regains hit points (2 for a category 1, 5 for a category 2, and 10 for a category 3) at the start of each of its turns if it has at least 1 hit point.
            
            d8 | Minor Adaptation
            1 | Amorphous Structure. The krasis can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.
            2 | Aquatic. The krasis gains a swimming speed equal to its walking speed.
            3 | Climbing Speed. The krasis gains a climbing speed equal to its walking speed.
            4 | Cryptic Skin. The krasis can change color to match its surroundings. It has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide.
            5 | Heightened Awareness. The krasis can't be surprised, as a result of having sensitive barbels like a catfish, stereoscopic vision like a chameleon, a tongue like a snake, eye stalks like a lobster, or an array of several eyes.
            6 | Ink Cloud (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). While underwater, the krasis can use a bonus action to expel a cloud of ink and then move up to its speed. The ink cloud is stationary and fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point in the krasis's space before it moves. The sphere is heavily obscured until the ink disperses after 1 minute. A strong current also disperses the ink cloud.
            7 | Leaping Legs. With or without a running start, the krasis's long jump is 20 feet (category 1), 30 feet (category 2), or 40 feet (category 3). Its high jump is 10 feet (category 1), 20 feet (category 2), or 30 feet (category 3).
            8 | Stabilizing Legs. The krasis has several crablike legs. As a result, it has advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws made against effects that would knock it prone.

            1 | Acidic Skin. Any creature that touches the krasis or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 2 (1d4) acid damage (category 1), 4 (1d8) acid damage (category 2), or 6 (1d12) acid damage (category 3).
            2 | Armored Hide. The krasis has better natural armor afforded by a shell or thick scales, increasing its Armor Class by 4.
            3 | Bioluminescent Markings. The krasis has glowing patterns on its skin that take the shape of defensive runes, granting it advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
            4 | Flight. The krasis has wings and gains a flying speed equal to its walking speed.
            5 | Grabber. When the krasis hits a creature with its claws, the target is grappled (escape DC 13 for category 1, DC 15 for category 2, and DC 19 for category 3) by a specialized grasping appendage on the krasis. It can have only one creature grappled in this way at a time.
            6 | Hypnotic Display (Recharge 5-6). As an action, the krasis creates mesmerizing colors and shapes around itself. Each creature within 15 feet of it that can see it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC 12 for category 1, DC 14 for category 2, and DC 18 for category 3) or be stunned for 1 minute. The stunned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on a saving throw against this effect becomes immune to the Hypnotic Display of all krasis for 24 hours.
            7 | Venomous Sting. When the krasis hits a creature with its claws, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 12 for category 1, DC 14 for category 2, and DC 18 for category 3) or be poisoned for 1 minute. If the krasis is a category 2 or 3, the creature is paralyzed while poisoned in this way. The poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
            8 | Regeneration. The krasis regains hit points (2 for a category 1, 5 for a category 2, and 10 for a category 3) at the start of each of its turns if it has at least 1 hit point.
            
            d8 | Minor Adaptation
            1 | Amorphous Structure. The krasis can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.
            2 | Aquatic. The krasis gains a swimming speed equal to its walking speed.
            3 | Climbing Speed. The krasis gains a climbing speed equal to its walking speed.
            4 | Cryptic Skin. The krasis can change color to match its surroundings. It has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide.
            5 | Heightened Awareness. The krasis can't be surprised, as a result of having sensitive barbels like a catfish, stereoscopic vision like a chameleon, a tongue like a snake, eye stalks like a lobster, or an array of several eyes.
            6 | Ink Cloud (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). While underwater, the krasis can use a bonus action to expel a cloud of ink and then move up to its speed. The ink cloud is stationary and fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point in the krasis's space before it moves. The sphere is heavily obscured until the ink disperses after 1 minute. A strong current also disperses the ink cloud.
            7 | Leaping Legs. With or without a running start, the krasis's long jump is 20 feet (category 1), 30 feet (category 2), or 40 feet (category 3). Its high jump is 10 feet (category 1), 20 feet (category 2), or 30 feet (category 3).
            8 | Stabilizing Legs. The krasis has several crablike legs. As a result, it has advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws made against effects that would knock it prone.

        <description>Isperia is the current guildmaster of the Azorius Senate. As a sphinx, she is aloof and values solitude above all. However, she has been forced to give up her privacy to deal with the increased crime and chaos on Ravnica.
            Isperia is devoted to her guild's belief that law is the ultimate bulwark against chaos, and it is her steady hand that guides the Azorius through these uncertain times. As guildmaster, Isperia serves as the supreme judge, a role that takes advantage of her encyclopedic knowledge of Ravnica's labyrinthine legal system.
            If an encounter turns violent, Isperia refrains from using lethal force if possible, preferring to subdue a wrongdoing so that the legal system can mete out justice.

        <description>The aerial forces of the Boros Legion-skyknights who fly alongside the angels-take to the air mounted on Skyjek rocs. These avians are named for the skyknights who are also part of the Wojek League, called Skyjeks. From the backs of their rocs, these mounted soldiers carry out reconnaissance missions, bombard enemies on the ground, and engage flying foes.
            The shape of a Skyjek roc's body makes it relatively easy to saddle and ride, and it is typically equipped with armor plating on its head and chest.
            Skyjek rocs are headstrong and impulsive, but their bravery makes them ideal mounts for the Boros knights.

        <description>The medusas of Ravnica, often called gorgons, are a monstrous race of creatures that appear superficially similar to human women. In place of hair, a gorgon has a writhing mass of black, serpentine cables, and its hands are scaly claws.
            The gaze of a medusa's glowing eyes causes living tissue to petrify. The transformation is rapid, leaving the victim as a stone statue, usually frozen in a position of abject fear or agony-a fine trophy for the medusa's macabre collection. The medusa must exert its will to effect this transformation, so the gaze of a surprised or friendly Ravnican medusa is harmless.
            This deadly gaze attack gives medusas a degree of power among the Golgari that is out of proportion with their small numbers. Medusas command a significant share of the guild's smaller cells around Ravnica, and at least one medusa is thought to be angling for control of the entire guild at the moment.
            Not all gorgons are so ambitious; some prefer to simply stalk the endless shadows of the undercity like hungry predators.

If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by the wurm. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the wurm, and takes 17 (5d6) acid damage at the start of each of the wurm's turns. If the wurm takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the wurm must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the wurm. If the wurm dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting prone.</text>

        <description>Wurms are huge creatures that resemble limbless, wingless dragons. They burrow through the earth and eat virtually anything they come across, and their movement accounts for much of the destruction in the rubblebelt regions of Ravnica. A wurm burrows through loose earth by using deep sonic vibrations to liquefy the earth in front of it and swim through the area. The soil resolidifies and closes behind it. Moving through rock is slower and more difficult, and the wurm leaves a tunnel in its wake. The Gruul Clans appreciate the devastation wurms can create, and the clans sometimes lure them into civilized areas where the destruction can be vast.

        <description>Lazav is uniquely qualified to be the Dimir guildmaster: he is a shapechanger whose mysterious genius is informed by agents from the entire Dimir network. He takes on a tremendous variety of guises as his needs and plans require. He might step out into the Ravnican streets as an elderly widow to eavesdrop at the bazaar, become a vedalken hussar of the Azorius Senate to sidestep a checkpoint, or transform into a Tin Street merchant to deceive a passing noble. His true form might be that of a doppelganger or some other creature; no one has ever seen it.

        <description>Orzhov Vampires
            Vampires thrive in the Orzhov Syndicate, where they can collect tithes and payments from their debtors in the form of blood. Their undead nature gives them the same immortality enjoyed by the oligarch spirits, but they remain capable of experiencing all the delights of their corporeal forms. In contrast to Orzhov spirits, they also retain their personalities, which are almost uniformly cruel.
            Blood Bond
            Consuming a creature's blood creates a sort of empathic bond that allows the blood drinker vampire to exert some magical influence over its victim.
            Vampires:
            Creatures of the night, vampires are ageless undead beings who subsist on the blood of the living. They are fierce predators who mask their ravenous thirst behind a facade of sophistication and sensuality. Those who sip blood from golden chalices are no less voracious than those who tear out their victims' throats with their fangs; they just hide it better.
            The vampires of Ravnica differ from those in the Monster Manual in important ways. They lack the traits and abilities that those other vampires boast, but also lack the weaknesses that hinder such vampires. What they have in common is an unquenchable thirst for the blood that sustains their undead existence.

        <description>Those who die with unpaid debts to the Orzhov Syndicate don't get a reprieve. Instead, their spirits serve the syndicate until they have worked off their obligation. Sometimes that means existing as an indentured spirit for years or even millennia.
            An indentured spirit is an incorporeal being draped in ghostly black robes and a hood that hides whatever face it might have. Chains are hung around its chest and arms as a perpetual marker of its servitude.

        <description>Szadek's Heirs
            The founder of House Dimir, Szadek, was the first of the so-called mind drinkers. His secrets are passed on only to other members of his guild, and mind drinkers who leave House Dimir become enemies of the guild-the only exceptions to a rule that prohibits mind drinkers from feeding on others of their kind.
            Cell Leaders
            Thanks to their particular gifts, mind drinkers are often placed as leaders of small cells of covert Dimir operatives. They rarely trust their own agents, though, and often follow their cell members to make sure those members carry out missions as ordered. The most suspicious vampires might even siphon thoughts from their subordinates to detect any hint of betrayal.
            Vampires:
            Creatures of the night, vampires are ageless undead beings who subsist on the blood of the living. They are fierce predators who mask their ravenous thirst behind a facade of sophistication and sensuality. Those who sip blood from golden chalices are no less voracious than those who tear out their victims' throats with their fangs; they just hide it better.
            The vampires of Ravnica differ from those in the Monster Manual in important ways. They lack the traits and abilities that those other vampires boast, but also lack the weaknesses that hinder such vampires. What they have in common is an unquenchable thirst for the blood that sustains their undead existence.

        <description>Limited Sentience
            A Nightveil specter is created when the mind magic of House Dimir erases a person's identity, leaving a mind so broken it can no longer live. Thus, Nightveil specters have no memory of their previous lives, and they are just clever enough to follow their orders with some amount of creativity. They pursue their assigned tasks with fearless determination.
            Gloamwing Mount
            If a gloamwing is killed, its specter becomes fixated on destroying those responsible. If the specter survives, it can create a new gloamwing over the course of a month, during which time the specter is incapacitated.
            A gloamwing's head is almost ratlike, with prominent teeth, and its leathery skin is stretched tight over its skull, where its eyes are empty sockets. Its body is mottled with bony plates, and great wings stretch from its shoulders.
            Undead Nature
            A Nightveil specter and its gloamwing mount don't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

            <text>If five Obzedat ghosts are all within 30 feet of each other, they can collectively take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creature's turn.

            <name>Innate Spellcasting</name>
            <text>The ghost's innate spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 16, +8 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:</text>
            <text>At will: chill touch (at 5th level, and the ghost regains hit points equal to half the amount of damage the target takes)</text>
            <text>1/day each: sanctuary, spirit guardians (at 4th level)</text>

        <description>Mostly Unanimous
            The ghosts of the Obzedat function as a unit, driven by their shared desire to accumulate ever more wealth for the guild. In times of disagreement, the eldest of the council exerts his seniority to bend the council to his will.
            Grandfather Karlov
            The head of the council, who gives final approval to its decisions and breaks ties within the group, is Karlov, known as Grandfather. In life, Karlov was the greediest of Orzhov oligarchs, and his many centuries as a spirit have not diminished his hunger for more wealth.
            Undead Nature
            An Obzedat ghost doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
            The Ghost Council's Traits
            Ideal: "Influence is measured in power, status, and money, but mostly money."
            Bond: "Gather as much as you can while you can, for when you die, you will take it with you."
            Flaw: "Everyone has a price."
