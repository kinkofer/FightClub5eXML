        <weight></weight>
        <property></property>
        <text>This Large cannon is imbued with magic. It requires no ammunition and doesn't need to be loaded. It takes one action to aim the cannon and one action to fire it. After the cannon has fired, it must recharge for 5 minutes before it can be fired again.</text>
        <text>The creature firing the cannon chooses the effect from the following options:</text>
        <text>Acid Jet: The cannon discharges acid in a line 300 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, a creature that fails its saving throw takes 11 (2d10) acid damage at the start of each of its turns; a creature can end this damage by using its action to wash off the acid with a pint or more of water.</text>
        <text>Fire Jet: The cannon discharges fire in a line 300 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 33 (6d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.</text>
        <text>Frost Shot: The cannon shoots a ball of frost to a point you can see within 1,200 feet of the cannon. The ball then expands to form a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 22 (4d10) cold damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and its speed isn't reduced. A creature whose speed is reduced by this effect can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>
        <text>Lightning Shot: The cannon shoots a ball of lightning to a point you can see within 1,200 feet of the cannon. The lightning then expands to form a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 33 (6d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures wearing metal armor have disadvantage on the save.</text>
        <text>Poison Spray: The cannon expels poison gas in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 22 (4d10) poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't poisoned. A creature poisoned in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>

        <text>• You can speak, read, and write Abyssal.</text>

        <text>• Whenever you kill a humanoid with an attack using the Blade of Broken Mirrors, the blade remembers the creature's appearance. While holding the dagger, you can use an action to change your form to match any humanoid the blade remembers. Your statistics, other than your size, don't change. Any equipment you are wearing or carrying isn't transformed. You can revert to your true appearance as an action. You revert to your true appearance automatically when you die. When the Blade of Broken Mirrors attunes to a new wielder, the appearances of humanoids it has killed are wiped from its memory.</text>
        <text>Awakened: When the dagger reaches an awakened state, it gains the following properties:</text>
        <text>• The weapon's bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +2.</text>
        <text>• While holding the weapon, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it (save DC 15): fabricate, hallucinatory terrain, major image, or phantasmal killer. Once a spell has been cast using the dagger, that spell can't be cast from the dagger again until the next dawn.</text>

        <text>• The weapon's bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +3.</text>

        <text>• While holding the dagger, you can turn invisible as an action. Anything you are wearing or carrying is invisible with you. You remain invisible until you stop holding the dagger, until you attack or cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw, or until you use a bonus action to become visible again.</text>

        <text>This mithral skeleton key was forged using the blood of twelve master thieves executed for trying to steal magic items during the Age of Arcanum.
        Dormant: The Infiltrator's Key grants the following benefits in its dormant state:
        • The key can be used as thieves' tools for the purpose of opening locks. When using the key, you are considered proficient in thieves' tools and you have advantage on ability checks made to open locks.
        • While holding the key, your steps are muffled, giving you advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to move silently.
        Awakened: When the Infiltrator's Key reaches an awakened state, it gains the following properties:
        • While holding the key, you can use a bonus action to transform the key into a magic dagger or back into a key. While the key is in the form of a dagger, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it, and it returns to your hand immediately after it is used to make a ranged attack.
        • While holding the key, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it: alter self, invisibility, knock, or pass without trace. Once a spell has been cast using the key, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn.
        Exalted: When the Infiltrator's Key reaches an exalted state, it gains the following properties:
        • As a bonus action, you can touch the key to a floor, wall, or ceiling that is no more than 5 feet thick and cause a magical opening to appear in the surface. When you create the opening, you choose its length and width, up to 10 feet for each dimension. The opening lasts until the key passes through it to the other side, at which point it disappears (if a creature is in the opening when the doorway closes, the creature is safely shunted to the nearest unoccupied space). The key can't be used to create another opening until the next dawn.
        • While holding the key, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it: dimension door, gaseous form, or mislead. Once a spell has been cast using the key, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn.

        <text>This snakeskin whip is touched by the power of Zehir and ends in five animated serpent heads.
        Sentience: The Lash of Shadows is a sentient chaotic evil weapon with an Intelligence of 18, a Wisdom of 16, and a Charisma of 20. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.
        The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Abyssal, Common, and Draconic.
        Personality: A mad marilith named Sizlifeth lives within the Lash of Shadows. The weapon has a short temper and experiences only extreme emotions. It is most happy when dealing harm.
        Dormant: The whip grants the following benefits in its dormant state:
        • You can speak, read, and write Abyssal and Draconic.
        • You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
        • You can attempt to poison any creature that is hit by the whip. The creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer the effect of one of the following poisons of your choice; once a poison other than Serpent Venom has been used, that poison can't be used again until the next dawn:
        Dead Eyes: A creature that fails the saving throw against this poison is poisoned for 1 hour. While poisoned in this way, the creature is blinded.
        Serpent Venom: A creature that fails the saving throw against this poison takes 3d6 poison damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.
        Awakened: When the whip reaches an awakened state, it gains the following properties:
        • The weapon's bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +2.
        • The saving throw DC for the weapon's poisons increases to 15.
        • The weapon gains a new poison option called Ghoul's Blood. A creature that fails the saving throw against this poison is poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned in this way, the creature is paralyzed. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
        Exalted: When the whip reaches an exalted state, it gains the following additional properties:
        • The weapon's bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +3.
        • The saving throw DC for the weapon's poisons increases to 17.
        • The weapon gains a new poison option called Cockatrice Tears. A creature that fails the saving throw against this poison begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified for 24 hours.
        Betrayer Artifact Properties: The Arms of the Betrayers advance in power in the same manner as the Vestiges of Divergence. In its dormant state, each of these artifacts has one minor beneficial property and one minor detrimental property. When the artifact attains an awakened state, it gains an additional minor beneficial property and an additional minor detrimental property. When the item reaches its exalted state, it gains a major beneficial property. See "Artifact Properties" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for more information.

        <text>This dodecahedron of faintly glowing crystal is heavier than it appears. A set of handles are affixed to its sides, and it pulsates and thrums when touched.
        Fragment of Possibility: A creature that touches the beacon and concentrates for 1 minute receives a Fragment of Possibility, which looks like a Tiny, grayish bead of energy that follows the creature around, staying within 1 foot of it at all times. The fragment lasts for 8 hours or until used. Once the beacon grants a Fragment of Possibility, it can't grant another until the next dawn. A creature with a Fragment of Possibility from a Luxon Beacon can't gain another Fragment of Possibility from any source.
        When a creature with a Fragment of Possibility makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, it can expend its fragment to roll an additional d20 and choose which of the d20s to use. Alternatively, when an attack roll is made against the creature, it can expend its fragment to roll a d20 and choose which of the d20s to use, the one it rolled or the one the attacker rolled.
        If the original d20 roll has advantage or disadvantage, the creature rolls its d20 after advantage or disadvantage has been applied to the original roll.
        Soul Snare: If a follower of the Luxon who has undergone a ritual of consecution dies within 100 miles of a Luxon Beacon, their soul is ensnared by it. This soul will be reincarnated within the body of a random humanoid baby developing within 100 miles of the beacon.

        <text>This mace has a haft of black iron and a ruby head with a fiendish countenance. Carrying the boon of Asmodeus, it is fit for the most powerful servants of the Nine Hells.
        Sentience: The Mace of the Black Crown is a sentient lawful evil weapon with an Intelligence of 20, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.
        The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common and Infernal.
        Personality: A greedy erinyes named Xartaza lives within the Mace of the Black Crown. Xartaza wants to recruit more souls for Asmodeus, so the weapon pushes its wielder toward lawful evil actions by manipulating the wielder's dreams. A former Blood War general, Xartaza hates demons and relishes crafting sound battle plans in any conflict.
        Dormant: The mace grants the following benefits in its dormant state:
        • You can speak, read, and write Infernal.
        • You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
        • While holding the mace, you can use a bonus action to speak its Infernal command word, causing flames to erupt from the head. These flames shed bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. While the mace is ablaze, it deals an extra 1d6 fire damage to any target it hits. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you are no longer holding the mace.
        • While holding the mace, you can use an action to summon an imp. Any devil you summon with this mace is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. The imp obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it and returns to the Nine Hells 10 minutes after you summoned it. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.
        Awakened: When the mace reaches an awakened state, it gains the following properties:
        • The weapon's bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +2, and the extra fire damage dealt by the weapon when it is ignited increases to 2d6.
        • The weapon's Summon Devil feature can also be used to summon a bearded devil.
        • You have resistance to poison damage while holding this weapon.
        Exalted: When the mace reaches an exalted state, it gains the following properties:
        • The weapon's bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +3, and the extra fire damage dealt by the weapon when it is ignited increases to 3d6. Fire damage dealt by the mace ignores resistance to fire damage.
        • The weapon's Summon Devil feature can also be used to summon a barbed devil.
        • You have resistance to fire damage while you hold this weapon.

All nonmagical flames within 30 feet of you automatically extinguish, and fire damage dealt by you is halved.

Pride silk has become a favorite cloth for use on military ship sails, war banners, and other utilitarian applications, but has also gained popularity in affluent circles. High-end clothing made from pride silk is both fashionable and protective, leading many nobles and wealthy merchants to seek full outfits and formal gowns made with it. The tailors skilled enough to create such outfits are few and far between, so while pride silk might be expensive as a raw material, outfits made of the cloth are prohibitively expensive for most common folk.

        • You can speak, read, and write Abyssal and Orc.
        • You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, and it deals an extra 1d8 piercing damage to any target it hits. Immediately after you make a ranged attack with this weapon, it flies back to your hand.
        • As a reaction when you are hit by a melee attack, you can make a melee attack with Ruin's Wake with advantage against the attacker. You can't use this property again until you finish a short or long rest.

        • The weapon's bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +2, and the extra piercing damage dealt by the weapon increases to 2d8.
        • When you hurl the spear and speak a command word, it transforms into a bolt of lightning, forming a line 5 feet wide that extends out from you to a creature you can see within 120 feet of you. Each creature in the line, excluding you, must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 8d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

        <text>The blade of this rapier is made of spider silk. Its onyx pommel is tipped with a ruby cut in the shape of a spider, and the blade carries the blessing of Lolth.
        Sentience: Silken Spite is a sentient chaotic evil weapon with an Intelligence of 13, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 15. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.
        The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Abyssal, Common, Elvish, and Undercommon.

        • You can use an action to cause poison to coat the rapier's blade. The poison remains for 1 minute or until an attack using this weapon hits a creature.

The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature uses its action to shake the creature awake.
        • While carrying the rapier, you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. Additionally, you can't be caught in webs of any sort and can move through webs as if they were difficult terrain.

        <text>Soothsalts are derived from a naturally occurring crystalline substance discovered throughout the wilds of the Miskath Strand. The crimson crystals have been mined from cavernous veins like those in the mouth of the Miskath Pit and found within smaller geode formations near sites ravaged by the Calamity. Soothsalts are consumed orally in lozenge-sized doses, and frequent users can be identified by the telltale crimson stain around their mouths. A creature subjected to a dose of soothsalts gains advantage on all Intelligence checks for 1d4 hours.
        For each dose of soothsalts consumed, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion—an effect which is cumulative with multiple doses.

        <text>This glass bottle can store one spell of up to 5th level at a time. When found, roll a d6 and subtract 1; the total determines the level of spell in the bottle (the DM chooses the spell, and 0 means the bottle is empty). A swirling blue vapor fills the bottle while it contains a spell.
        When the bottle is empty, any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 5th level into it by touching it while casting. The spell has no effect other than to be stored in the bottle.
        While holding the bottle, you can cast the spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The bottle becomes empty once the spell is cast.
        If you're holding the empty bottle when you see a creature casting a spell within 60 feet of you, you can open the bottle as a reaction in an attempt to interrupt the spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell has no effect, and it is stored in the bottle. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an Intelligence check. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a success, the spell has no effect, and it is stored in the bottle.

        While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 2 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: fortune's favor (2 charges), pulse wave (3 charges), or gravity sinkhole (4 charges).

        Dormant: While wearing the wreath in its dormant state, you have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, wearing the wreath increases the range of your darkvision by 60 feet.
        When you hit a beast, dragon, or monstrosity of challenge rating 5 or lower with an attack, or when you grapple it, you can use the wreath to cast dominate monster on the creature (save DC 13). On a successful save, the target is immune to the power of the wreath for 24 hours. On a failure, a shimmering, golden image of the wreath appears as a collar around the target's neck or as a crown on its head (your choice) until it is no longer charmed by the spell. If you use the wreath to charm a second creature, the first spell immediately ends. When the spell ends, the target knows it was charmed by you.
        Awakened: Once the Wreath of the Prism reaches an awakened state, it gains the following benefits:
        • You can affect creatures of challenge rating 10 or lower with the wreath.
        • The save DC of the wreath's spell increases to 15.
        Exalted: Once the Wreath of the Prism reaches an exalted state, it gains the following benefits:
        • You can affect creatures of challenge rating 15 or lower with the wreath.
        • The save DC of the wreath's spell increases to 17.

        The black blade of this sword is crafted from a mysterious arcane alloy. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While the sword is on your person, you are immune to effects that turn undead.
        Dark Blessing: While holding the sword, you can use an action to give yourself 1d4 + 4 temporary hit points. This property can't be used again until the next dusk.
        Disheartening Strike: When you hit a creature with an attack using this weapon, you can fill the target with unsettling dread: the target has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes before the end of your next turn. The creature ignores this effect if it's immune to the frightened condition. Once you use this property, you can't do so again until the next dusk.

        <text>Special: A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net. When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

        <text>Special: If you attack with a double-bladed scimitar as part of the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action immediately after to make a melee attack with it. This attack deals 1d4 slashing damage on a hit, instead of 2d4.
        You can use a bonus action to toss this magic sword into the air and speak the command word. When you do so, the sword begins to hover, flies up to 30 feet, and attacks one creature of your choice within 5 feet of it. The sword uses your attack roll and ability score modifier to damage rolls.
        While the sword hovers, you can use a bonus action to cause it to fly up to 30 feet to another spot within 30 feet of you. As part of the same bonus action, you can cause the sword to attack one creature within 5 feet of it.
        After the hovering sword attacks for the fourth time, it flies up to 30 feet and tries to return to your hand. If you have no hand free, it falls to the ground at your feet. If the sword has no unobstructed path to you, it moves as close to you as it can and then falls to the ground. It also ceases to hover if you grasp it or move more than 30 feet away from it.

        <text>Special: A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net. When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

A yklwa consists of a 3-foot wooden shaft with a steel or stone blade up to 18 inches long. Although it has the thrown weapon property, the yklwa is not well balanced for throwing.

            <name>Age</name>
            <text>Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.</text>

        <trait>
            <name>Alignment</name>
            <text>Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others' freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not.</text>

            <name>Darkvision</name>
            <text>Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</text>

        <trait>
            <name>Trance</name>
            <text>Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is "trance.") While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.</text>
            <text>If you meditate during a long rest, you finish the rest after only 4 hours. You otherwise obey all the rules for a long rest; only the duration is changed.</text>

            <name>Languages</name>
            <text>You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.</text>

        <trait>
            <name>Breath Weapon</name>
            <text>You can use your action to exhale destructive energy. Your draconic ancestry determines the size, shape, and damage type of the exhalation.</text>
            <text>When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by your draconic ancestry. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level.</text>

                <name>Martial Archetype: Echo Knight</name>
                <text>A mysterious and feared frontline warrior of the Kryn Dynasty, the Echo Knight has mastered the art of using dunamis to summon the fading shades of unrealized timelines to aid them in battle. Surrounded by echoes of their own might, they charge into the fray as a cycling swarm of shadows and strikes.</text>
                <text></text>
                <text>Manifest Echo</text>
                <text>   3rd-level Echo Knight feature</text>
                <text>   You can use a bonus action to magically manifest an echo of yourself in an unoccupied space you can see within 15 feet of you. This echo is a magical, translucent, gray image of you that lasts until it is destroyed, until you dismiss it as a bonus action, until you manifest another echo, or until you're incapacitated.</text>
                <text>   Your echo has AC 14 + your proficiency bonus, 1 hit point, and immunity to all conditions. If it has to make a saving throw, it uses your saving throw bonus for the roll. It is the same size as you, and it occupies its space. On your turn, you can mentally command the echo to move up to 30 feet in any direction (no action required). If your echo is ever more than 30 feet from you at the end of your turn, it is destroyed.</text>
                <text>   You can use the echo in the following ways:</text>
                <text>• As a bonus action, you can teleport, magically swapping places with your echo at a cost of 15 feet of your movement, regardless of the distance between the two of you.</text>
                <text>• When you take the Attack action on your turn, any attack you make with that action can originate from your space or the echo's space. You make this choice for each attack.</text>
                <text>• When a creature that you can see within 5 feet of your echo moves at least 5 feet away from it, you can use your reaction to make an opportunity attack against that creature as if you were in the echo's space.</text>

While your echo is being used in this way, it can be up to 1,000 feet away from you without being destroyed.</text>

                <text>   You can peer through possible futures and magically pull one of them into events around you, ensuring a particular outcome. When you or a creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to ignore the die roll and decide whether the number rolled is the minimum needed to succeed or one less than that number (your choice).</text>
                <text>   When you use this feature, you gain one level of exhaustion. Only by finishing a long rest can you remove a level of exhaustion gained in this way.</text>

                <text>   As an action, you can magically emit a powerful field of gravitational energy that tugs at other creatures for up to 1 minute or until your concentration ends (as if you were concentrating on a spell). For the duration, whenever a creature hostile to you starts its turn within 30 feet of you, it must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, it takes 2d10 force damage, and its speed is reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage, and every foot it moves this turn costs 2 extra feet of movement.</text>
                <text>   Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest or until you expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher on it.</text>

        <text>This spell creates a sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The sphere can have a radius of up to 40 feet. The area within this sphere is filled with magical darkness and crushing gravitational force.</text>
        <text>For the duration, the spell's area is difficult terrain. A creature with darkvision can't see through the magical darkness, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it. No sound can be created within or pass through the area. Any creature or object entirely inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are deafened while entirely inside it. Casting a spell that includes a verbal component is impossible there.</text>
        <text>Any creature that enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 8d10 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage is disintegrated. A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust.</text>
