        <text>This magic weapon grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While you hold the sword, you have advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws, you are immune to being charmed, and you have resistance to psychic damage. In addition, if you score a critical hit with it against a creature&#8217;s astral body, you can cut the silvery cord that tethers the target to its material body, instead of dealing damage.</text>
        <text>    </text>
        <text>Heavy: Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.</text>
        <text>    </text>
        <text>Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.</text>

        <text>A narzugon binds a nightmare to its service with infernal tack, which consists of a bridle, bit, reins, saddle, stirrups, and spurs. A nightmare equipped with infernal tack must serve whoever wears the spurs until the wearer dies or the tack is removed. You can use an action to call a nightmare equipped with infernal tack by clashing the spurs together or scraping them through blood. The nightmare appears at the start of your next turn, within 20 feet of you. It acts as your ally and takes its turn on your initiative count. It remains for 1 day, until you or it dies, or until you dismiss it as an action. If the nightmare dies, it reforms in the Nine Hells within 24 hours, after which you can summon it again. The tack doesn&#8217;t conjure a nightmare from thin air; one must first be subdued so the tack can be placed on it. No nightmare accepts this forced servitude willingly, but some eventually form strong loyalties to their masters and become true partners in evil.</text>

            <text>     </text>
            <text>Winter: When you use your Fey Step, one creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of you before you teleport must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>Spring: When you use your Fey Step, you can touch one willing creature within 5 feet of you. That creature then teleports instead of you, appearing in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you.</text>

            <text>Summer: Immediately after you use your Fey Step, each creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of you takes fire damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 damage).</text>

            <name>Shifting Seasons</name>
            <text>Eladrin are elves native to the Feywild, a realm of beauty, unpredictable emotion, and boundless magic. An eladrin is associated with one of the four seasons and has coloration reminiscent of that season, which can also affect the eladrin&#8217;s mood:</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>Autumn is the season of peace and goodwill, when summer&#8217;s harvest is shared with all.</text>
            <text>Winter is the season of contemplation and dolor, when the vibrant energy of the world slumbers.</text>
            <text>Spring is the season of cheerfulness and celebration, marked by merriment as winter&#8217;s sorrow passes.</text>
            <text>Summer is the season of boldness and aggression, a time of unfettered energy.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>    Some eladrin remain associated with a particular season for their entire lives, whereas other eladrin transform, adopting characteristics of a new season. When finishing a long rest, any eladrin can change their season. An eladrin might choose the season that is present in the world or perhaps the season that most closely matches the eladrin&#8217;s current emotional state. For example, an eladrin might shift to autumn if filled with contentment, another eladrin could change to winter if plunged into sorrow, still another might be bursting with joy and become an eladrin of spring, and fury might cause an eladrin to change to summer.</text>

        <text>You have inherited the innate spellcasting ability of your ancestors. This ability allows you to cast nondetection on yourself at will, without needing a material component. You can also cast each of the following spells once with this ability: blindness/deafness, blur, and disguise self. You regain the ability to cast these spells when you finish a long rest.</text>
        <text>    Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells, and you cast them at their lowest possible levels.</text>

The oblex can impersonate 1d4 + 1 different creatures, each one tethered to its body by a strand of slime that can extend up to 120 feet away.

Constructs, oozes, plants, and undead succeed on the save automatically.</text>
            <text>    While memory drained, the target must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from any ability check or attack roll it makes.

The effect then ends.</text>

        </trait>
        <trait>
            <name>Individual Designs</name>
            <text>A gnome artisan values an individualized clockwork more highly than a perfectly functioning one that copies too much from another creation. For that reason, even clockworks that fit established designs, such as those described here, are seldom identical.</text>
            <text>    A clockwork can be customized by adding one of the following enhancements and one potential malfunction to its stat block. You can select randomly or choose a pair of modifications that fit the temperament of the clockwork's builder.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>d10 &#8212; Enhancement:</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>1 &#8212; Camouflaged. The clockwork gains proficiency in Stealth if it doesn't already have it. While motionless, it is indistinguishable from a stopped machine.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>2 &#8212; Sensors. The range of the clockwork's darkvision becomes 120 feet, unless it is higher, and it gains proficiency in Perception if it doesn't already have it.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>3 &#8212; Improved Armor. The clockwork's AC increases by 2.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>4 &#8212; Increased Speed. The clockwork's speed increases by 10 feet.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>5 &#8212; Reinforced Construction. The clockwork has resistance to force, lightning, and thunder damage.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>6 &#8212; Self-Repairing. If the clockwork starts its turn with at least 1 hit point, it regains 5 hit points. If it takes lightning damage, this ability doesn't function at the start of its next turn.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>7 &#8212; Sturdy Frame. The clockwork's hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to its number of Hit Dice.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>8 &#8212; Suction. The clockwork gains a climbing speed of 30 feet.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>9 &#8212; Vocal Resonator. The clockwork gains the ability to speak rudimentary Common or Gnomish (creator's choice).</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>10 &#8212; Water Propulsion. The clockwork gains a swimming speed of 30 feet.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>Clockwork Malfunctions:</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>d10 &#8212; Malfunction</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>1 &#8212; Faulty Sensors. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is blinded until the end of its turn.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>2 &#8212; Flawed Targeting. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork makes attack rolls with disadvantage until the end of its turn.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>3 &#8212; Ground Fault. The clockwork has vulnerability to lightning damage.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>4 &#8212; Imprinting Loop. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork mistakes one creature it can see within 30 feet for its creator. The clockwork won't willingly harm that creature for 1 minute or until that creature attacks it or deals damage to it.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>5 &#8212; Leaking Lubricant. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork gains 1 level of exhaustion that it isn't immune to.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>6 &#8212; Limited Steering. The clockwork must move in a straight line. It can turn up to 90 degrees before moving and again at the midpoint of its movement. It can rotate freely if it doesn't use any of its speeds on its turn.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>7 &#8212; Overactive Sense of Self-Preservation. If the clockwork has half its hit points or fewer at the start of its turn in combat, roll a d6. If you roll a 1, it retreats from combat. If retreat isn't possible, it continues fighting.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>8 &#8212; Overheats. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is incapacitated until the end of its turn.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>9 &#8212; Rusty Gears. The clockwork has disadvantage on initiative rolls, and its speed decreases by 10 feet.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>10 &#8212; Weak Armor. The clockwork isn't immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that aren't adamantine.</text>

            <text>     </text>
            <text>&#8226; The corpse flower digests one humanoid corpse in its body and instantly regains 11 (2d10) hit points. Nothing of the digested body remains. Any equipment on the corpse is expelled from the corpse flower in its space.</text>

            <text>Demogorgon turns his magical gaze toward one creature that he can see within 120 feet of him. That target must make a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw. Unless the target is incapacitated, it can avert its eyes to avoid the gaze and to automatically succeed on the save. If the target does so, it can't see Demogorgon until the start of his next turn. If the target looks at him in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.</text>
            <text>    If the target fails the save, the target suffers one of the following effects of Demogorgon's choice or at random:</text>
            <text>    1. Beguiling Gaze: The target is stunned until the start of Demogorgon's next turn or until Demogorgon is no longer within line of sight.</text>
            <text>    2. Hypnotic Gaze: The target is charmed by Demogorgon until the start of Demogorgon's next turn. Demogorgon chooses how the charmed target uses its actions, reactions, and movement. Because this gaze requires Demogorgon to focus both heads on the target, he can't use his Maddening Gaze legendary action until the start of his next turn.</text>
            <text>    3. Insanity Gaze: The target suffers the effect of the confusion spell without making a saving throw. The effect lasts until the start of Demogorgon's next turn. Demogorgon doesn't need to concentrate on the spell.</text>

            <text>&#8226; Demogorgon creates an illusory duplicate of himself, which appears in his own space and lasts until initiative count 20 of the next round. On his turn, Demogorgon can move the illusory duplicate a distance equal to his walking speed (no action required). The first time a creature or object interacts physically with Demogorgon (for example, by hitting him with an attack), there is a 50 percent chance that the illusory duplicate is being affected, not Demogorgon himself, in which case the illusion disappears. </text>

            <text>Each creature within 60 feet of the eidolon that can see it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of it for 1 minute. While frightened in this way, the creature must take the Dash action and move away from the eidolon by the safest available route at the start of each of its turns, unless there is nowhere for it to move, in which case the creature also becomes stunned until it can move again. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to any eidolon's Divine Dread for the next 24 hours.</text>

            <name>Individual Designs</name>
            <text>A gnome artisan values an individualized clockwork more highly than a perfectly functioning one that copies too much from another creation. For that reason, even clockworks that fit established designs, such as those described here, are seldom identical.</text>
            <text>    A clockwork can be customized by adding one of the following enhancements and one potential malfunction to its stat block. You can select randomly or choose a pair of modifications that fit the temperament of the clockwork's builder.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>d10 &#8212; Enhancement:</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>1 &#8212; Camouflaged. The clockwork gains proficiency in Stealth if it doesn't already have it. While motionless, it is indistinguishable from a stopped machine.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>2 &#8212; Sensors. The range of the clockwork's darkvision becomes 120 feet, unless it is higher, and it gains proficiency in Perception if it doesn't already have it.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>3 &#8212; Improved Armor. The clockwork's AC increases by 2.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>4 &#8212; Increased Speed. The clockwork's speed increases by 10 feet.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>5 &#8212; Reinforced Construction. The clockwork has resistance to force, lightning, and thunder damage.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>6 &#8212; Self-Repairing. If the clockwork starts its turn with at least 1 hit point, it regains 5 hit points. If it takes lightning damage, this ability doesn't function at the start of its next turn.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>7 &#8212; Sturdy Frame. The clockwork's hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to its number of Hit Dice.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>8 &#8212; Suction. The clockwork gains a climbing speed of 30 feet.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>9 &#8212; Vocal Resonator. The clockwork gains the ability to speak rudimentary Common or Gnomish (creator's choice).</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>10 &#8212; Water Propulsion. The clockwork gains a swimming speed of 30 feet.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>Clockwork Malfunctions:</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>d10 &#8212; Malfunction</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>1 &#8212; Faulty Sensors. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is blinded until the end of its turn.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>2 &#8212; Flawed Targeting. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork makes attack rolls with disadvantage until the end of its turn.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>3 &#8212; Ground Fault. The clockwork has vulnerability to lightning damage.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>4 &#8212; Imprinting Loop. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork mistakes one creature it can see within 30 feet for its creator. The clockwork won't willingly harm that creature for 1 minute or until that creature attacks it or deals damage to it.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>5 &#8212; Leaking Lubricant. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork gains 1 level of exhaustion that it isn't immune to.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>6 &#8212; Limited Steering. The clockwork must move in a straight line. It can turn up to 90 degrees before moving and again at the midpoint of its movement. It can rotate freely if it doesn't use any of its speeds on its turn.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>7 &#8212; Overactive Sense of Self-Preservation. If the clockwork has half its hit points or fewer at the start of its turn in combat, roll a d6. If you roll a 1, it retreats from combat. If retreat isn't possible, it continues fighting.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>8 &#8212; Overheats. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is incapacitated until the end of its turn.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>9 &#8212; Rusty Gears. The clockwork has disadvantage on initiative rolls, and its speed decreases by 10 feet.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>10 &#8212; Weak Armor. The clockwork isn't immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that aren't adamantine.</text>
        </trait>
        <action>
            <name>Bite</name>
            <text>Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer one random poison effect:</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>1. Poison Damage: The target takes 13 (3d8) poison damage.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>2. Confusion: On its next turn, the target must use its action to make one weapon attack against a random creature it can see within 30 feet of it, using whatever weapon it has in hand and moving beforehand if necessary to get in range. If it's holding no weapon, it makes an unarmed strike. If no creature is visible within 30 feet, it takes the Dash action, moving toward the nearest creature.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>3. Paralysis: The target is paralyzed until the end of its next turn.</text>
            <text>    </text>
            <text>Paralyzed:</text>
            <text>&#8226; A paralyzed creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, and can't move or speak.</text>
            <text>    </text>

            <text>    </text>

The devouring requires the nabassu to be within 5 feet of the corpse for at least 10 minutes, after which it gains a number of Hit Dice (d8s) equal to half the creature's number of Hit Dice. Roll those dice, and increase the nabassu's hit points by the numbers rolled. For every 4 Hit Dice the nabassu gains in this way, its attacks deal an extra 3 (1d6) damage on a hit.

        </trait>
        <trait>
            <name>Individual Designs</name>
            <text>A gnome artisan values an individualized clockwork more highly than a perfectly functioning one that copies too much from another creation. For that reason, even clockworks that fit established designs, such as those described here, are seldom identical.</text>
            <text>    A clockwork can be customized by adding one of the following enhancements and one potential malfunction to its stat block. You can select randomly or choose a pair of modifications that fit the temperament of the clockwork's builder.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>d10 &#8212; Enhancement:</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>1 &#8212; Camouflaged. The clockwork gains proficiency in Stealth if it doesn't already have it. While motionless, it is indistinguishable from a stopped machine.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>2 &#8212; Sensors. The range of the clockwork's darkvision becomes 120 feet, unless it is higher, and it gains proficiency in Perception if it doesn't already have it.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>3 &#8212; Improved Armor. The clockwork's AC increases by 2.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>4 &#8212; Increased Speed. The clockwork's speed increases by 10 feet.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>5 &#8212; Reinforced Construction. The clockwork has resistance to force, lightning, and thunder damage.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>6 &#8212; Self-Repairing. If the clockwork starts its turn with at least 1 hit point, it regains 5 hit points. If it takes lightning damage, this ability doesn't function at the start of its next turn.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>7 &#8212; Sturdy Frame. The clockwork's hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to its number of Hit Dice.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>8 &#8212; Suction. The clockwork gains a climbing speed of 30 feet.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>9 &#8212; Vocal Resonator. The clockwork gains the ability to speak rudimentary Common or Gnomish (creator's choice).</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>10 &#8212; Water Propulsion. The clockwork gains a swimming speed of 30 feet.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>Clockwork Malfunctions:</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>d10 &#8212; Malfunction</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>1 &#8212; Faulty Sensors. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is blinded until the end of its turn.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>2 &#8212; Flawed Targeting. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork makes attack rolls with disadvantage until the end of its turn.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>3 &#8212; Ground Fault. The clockwork has vulnerability to lightning damage.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>4 &#8212; Imprinting Loop. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork mistakes one creature it can see within 30 feet for its creator. The clockwork won't willingly harm that creature for 1 minute or until that creature attacks it or deals damage to it.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>5 &#8212; Leaking Lubricant. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork gains 1 level of exhaustion that it isn't immune to.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>6 &#8212; Limited Steering. The clockwork must move in a straight line. It can turn up to 90 degrees before moving and again at the midpoint of its movement. It can rotate freely if it doesn't use any of its speeds on its turn.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>7 &#8212; Overactive Sense of Self-Preservation. If the clockwork has half its hit points or fewer at the start of its turn in combat, roll a d6. If you roll a 1, it retreats from combat. If retreat isn't possible, it continues fighting.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>8 &#8212; Overheats. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is incapacitated until the end of its turn.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>9 &#8212; Rusty Gears. The clockwork has disadvantage on initiative rolls, and its speed decreases by 10 feet.</text>
            <text>     </text>
            <text>10 &#8212; Weak Armor. The clockwork isn't immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that aren't adamantine.</text>

A creature takes 5 (1d10) slashing damage if it escapes from the grapple or if it tries and fails. As a bonus action, the oaken bolter can pull a creature grappled by it 20 feet closer.

In addition, the oinoloth can end one disease on the target or remove one of the following conditions from it: blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned. The target then gains 1 level of exhaustion, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 7 (2d6).

            <text></text>
            <text>If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.</text>
            <text>    A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.</text>
            <text>    An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.</text>

            <name>Variant: Flesh Warping</name>
            <text>Creatures that encounter a sibriex can be twisted beyond recognition. Whenever a creature fails a saving throw against the sibriex's Warp Creature effect, you can roll percentile dice and consult the Flesh Warping table to determine an additional effect, which vanishes when Warp Creature ends on the creature. If the creature transforms into an abyssal wretch, the effect becomes a permanent feature of that body.</text>
            <text>    A creature can willingly submit to flesh warping, an agonizing process that takes at least 1 hour while the creature stays within 30 feet of the sibriex. At the end of the process, roll once on the table (or choose one effect) to determine how the creature is transformed permanently.</text>

            <text>As a bonus action after moving at least 10 feet on the ground, the zaratan can send a shock wave through the ground in a 120-foot-radius circle centered on itself. That area becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute. Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw or the creature's concentration is broken.</text>
            <text>    The shock wave deals 100 thunder damage to all structures in contact with the ground in the area. If a creature is near a structure that collapses, the creature might be buried; a creature within half the distance of the structure's height must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 17 (5d6) bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is trapped in the rubble. A trapped creature is restrained, requiring a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. Another creature within 5 feet of the buried creature can use its action to clear rubble and grant advantage on the check. If three creatures use their actions in this way, the check is an automatic success. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn't fall prone or become trapped.</text>
